<i>Back to our amoeba.</i>

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,174
<i>It engulfs a bacterium with unique powers,
and... voilà.</i>

11
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,927
<i>Earth's first
photosynthesis-enabled organism.</i>

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>Maybe it was chance.</i>

13
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,307

<i>becomes the ancestor
of every living plant on Earth,</i>

<i>which in turn floods the planet with oxygen... paving
the way for every other form of life we know...</i>

17
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,490
<i>leading to more souls, more connections,</i>

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,910

branching outward from the first.</i>

Mr. Milgrim, can you state for the court

69
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,331
your relationship with the defendant,
Mr. Jed Milgrim?

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,209
He's, um...

71
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,045
- He's my brother.
- Thank you.

72
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,782
Have you ever been arrested? - No.
- Are you married?

73
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,344
- No.
- Children?

74
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,765
No.

75
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,018
And can you tell us
about the psychotic break

76
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,396
that you experienced
roughly ten years ago?

77
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,774
- Really?
- I'm just asking.

78
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,193
That's how they're gonna start?
Dad, come on.

79
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:43,074
It doesn't necessarily mean that
it'll be like that in the trial, Owen,

80
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,578
but, uh, sometimes prosecutors, they...

81
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,373
they try atypical inroads...

82
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,167
to crack you.

83
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,838
That's why we...
we have to prep for the unexpected.

84
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,841
Can you resume, please?

85
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,303
Have you ever been hospitalized
for mental illness?

86
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,563
Yes, ten years ago.

87
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,857
Please explain what happened.

88
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,776
I was hospitalized...

89
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,945
and medicated...

90
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,948
and...

91
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,956
that was the last episode I had.

92
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,959
Wasn't the nature
of this psychosis delusional?

93
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,463
That you sometimes thought you saw
your brother when he wasn't there?

94
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,173
Not exactly.

95
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,383
Just say no.

96
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,553
Then what was the nature
of this psychosis?

97
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,779
Owen, don't you think
that your mental illness

98
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,199
should disqualify you from testifying
as a witness on your brother's behalf?

99
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,118
Look, there's only one question here
that really matters.

100
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,829
Owen, do you know what is real?

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,879
One hundred percent.

102
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,508
I'm<i> compos mentis.</i>

Statue of Extra Liberty. Okay.

106
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,244
How'd the trial prep go
for a naughty brother?

107
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,704
Did you tell them about me?

108
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,332
You're not supposed to be here.

109
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,252

a doozy for you, huh?

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,803

but I have new information.

00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,648
- When?
- Well, they randomized the pattern.

177
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,359
We've sent out 30 memos on it
since this morning.

178
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,445
Um, so this furlough,
how long does it last?

179
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,697
- It's temporary.
- Right.

180
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,158
So... when am I back?

181
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,745
Oh, I don't know. I was kidding.
It's probably permanent.

182
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,044
I was using your kind of humor,

183
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,589
when you say something you don't mean
and nobody laughs.

184
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,468
It's... Yeah, it's okay. I'll just...

185
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,513
I'll just dip into my savings.

186
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,184
Bye.

187
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,632
THE PATTERN IS THE PATTERN

188
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,051
<i>Okay, Owen.</i>

189
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,888
<i>- Do you know what I want to do?</i>
<i>- </i><i>Yes.</i>

190
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,224
<i>Are you sure you know
what I want to do?</i>

191
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,684
<i>Yes.</i>

192
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,187
<i>The way this deprogramming works,
it's not an overnight fix.</i>

193
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
<i>You have to listen to it like a mantra.</i>

194
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,527
<i>If you start feeling paranoid,
you play this tape right away, okay?</i>

195
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,194
<i>Okay.</i>

196
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,240
<i>Now, stop me when I say something
that's not true.</i>

197
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,492
<i>The world sends you messages.</i>

198
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,244
<i>Yes.</i>

199
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,204
<i>Words are often code words,</i>

200
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,166
<i>or pass phrases for important secrets.</i>

201
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,500
<i>Yes.</i>

202
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,628
<i>You're visited by a brother
no one else in your family is aware of.</i>

203
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,839
<i>A facsimile of your brother Jed.</i>

204
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,133
<i>- Yes.
- He sends you messages.</i>

205
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,595
<i>Instructions for important missions
you must accomplish.</i>

206
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,930
<i>To see the deeper truth.</i>

207
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,349
<i>He tells you you're meant
to do something big,</i>

208
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,553
<i>something that matters to the world,
and that you're not meant to do it alone.</i>

209
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,064
<i>All you need is a partner.</i>

210
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,108
<i>Yes.</i>

211
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,069
<i>You made a promise to me,
and you made a promise to yourself.</i>

212
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>You promised we'd golf together
in Hilton Head.</i>

213
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,826
<i>You sense danger all around you,
but you stay disciplined.</i>

214
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,495
<i>A fight's coming.</i>

215
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>Something even bigger than this world.</i>

216
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,374
<i>Possibly extending to multiple galaxies.</i>

217
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,710
<i>- Fourth floor. Thank you.
- Yes.</i>

218
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,253
Hello, Mrs. Finkelstein.

219
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,963
Fuck off, Donovan.

220
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,424
It's, uh... Owen.

221
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,178
- Owen Milgrim...
- Fuck off, Donovan.

222
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,261
Never mind. <i>Good.</i>

223
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,391
<i>Does it feel good to be heard?</i>

224
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,351
<i>Yes.</i>

225
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,021
<i>Does it feel good to know that
you're not alone with this information?</i>

226
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,231
<i>Yeah.</i>

227
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,191
<i>Will you complete your mission?</i>

228
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,108
<i>Maybe.</i>

229
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,861
<i>Am I a trusted messenger?</i>

230
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,239
<i>Yes.</i>

231
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,741
<i>Good.
Then here are your real instructions.</i>

232
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,596
<i>Repeat after me. There is no pattern.</i>

233
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,996
<i>There is no pattern.</i>

234
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,958
<i>I am vulnerable,
but I am not stupid.</i>

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,294
<i>I'm vulnerable, but I'm not stupid.</i>

236
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,006
<i>But I will seek out the people
in my life that care about me.</i>

237
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,260
<i>I will seek out the people
in my life who care about me.</i>

238
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,845
<i>I am not the chosen one.</i>

239
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,763
<i>I am not the chosen one.</i>

240
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,647
<i>The voices aren't real.</i>

241
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,952
- <i>The voices aren't real.</i>
- The voices aren't real.

242
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,644
<i>The voices are just noise.</i>

243
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,164
- <i>The voices are just noise.</i>
- The voices are just noise.

244
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,316
<i>I am just a guy
with a vivid imagination.</i>

245
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,777
<i>I'm just a guy
with a vivid imagination.</i>

246
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,824
<i>I will most likely
not be the savior of our galaxy.</i>

247
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,907
Hello?

248
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,913
<i>I've got a package
from Neberdine Pharmaceutical Biotech</i>

249
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,957
<i>for an Owen Milgrim.</i>

250
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,793
What?

251
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,547
<i>I've... a package... your name.</i>

252
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,244
Hello?

253
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,873
<i>Hi, Owen.
Did you get what I sent you?</i>

254
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,124
How did you...

255
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,628
<i>I've just been informed
that you qualify as a hero candidate.</i>

256
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,064
- What does that mean?
<i>- </i><i>It's a term we use</i>

257
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,133
<i>for those who've been specifically
selected for one of our studies.</i>

258
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,802
<i>You're a very desirable individual
to us, Owen.</i>

259
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,097
<i>I've never seen B.N. over-ratios
like this before.</i>

260
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,478
What does a hero candidate do?

261
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,939
<i>Exactly the things
they were born to.</i>

262
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:44,360
<i>In your case, helping us treat maladies
ranging from sluggishness and depression</i>

263
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,405
<i>to I.B.S, to popcorn problems
and irrational fears.</i>

264
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,867
"Popcorn problems"?

265
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,535
<i>Prostate problems, yes.</i>

266
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,829
Oh, I thought you...

267
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,666
<i>We'll give you all the details
when you come in.</i>

268
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,668
<i>So, we'll see you on Monday?</i>

269
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,224
Good evening, Mr. Milgrim.

270
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,726
Everyone is on the patio for the recital.

271
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810
Thank you.

272
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,587
Thank you.

273
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,174
Where does she sleep when she stays over?

274
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,091
This one?

275
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,926
Yeah, she's your sister, right?

276
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,889
Or is she a secret agent?

277
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,808
How did you know?

278
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,189
Because I have super-secret sources

279
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,941
at a super-secret agency.

280
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,651
Don't tell anyone.

281
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,736
Okay.

282
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,446
Supper's ready.

283
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,490
Okay, Mom.

284
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,784
I was completely baffled.

285
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,702
You know, I left for school.

286
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,372
Ernie was fine, and then, you know,
the food was in the bowl.

287
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,291
The water was there,
cage was locked up,

288
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,543
and I get back from basketball practice,

289
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,339
- and he's just gone, absolutely...
- The great gerbil escape artist.

290
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,675
- But he wasn't exactly fucking gone.
- Language, Phil.

291
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,637
No, that's correct.
He wasn't exactly fucking gone like that.

292
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,597
- Language, Jed.
- Where'd he go, O?

293
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,101
Maybe you shouldn't curse so much
in front of the children.

294
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,954
- Ah, come on. Tell the rest.
- This is not a farmyard, boys.

295
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,230
So, um, I ask everyone, right?

296
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,774
Everyone's looking around the whole house,
everyone frantic,

297
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,610
and finally Owen, you know,
eventually comes up

298
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,028
and brings me to his room...

299
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,215
How old were you then, Owen?
Like, eight or somethin'?

300
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,758
- Nine.
- Eight or nine, whatever.

301
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,075
And he says... he says,

302
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:42,204
"Uh, I have to tell you somethin'.
My... my hawk ate Ernie."

303
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,915
"What?" And he points over there,

304
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,167
and there's
this big fuckin' red-tailed hawk

305
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,044
sitting on his desk staring at me.

306
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,463
What eight-year-old has a fuckin' hawk?

307
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,298
Uh, how did you have a hawk?

308
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,136
Um, I rescued it from the park.

309
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,140
I found it with a broken wing
and brought it to my room and fed it.

310
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,100
- Yeah, I forgot.
- You'd feed him.

311
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,020
That was the craziest part. He would
feed it, like a mother bird, you know...

312
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,816
Oh, masticate... No, no, no. Premasticate.

313
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,235
- Yeah, premastication!
- Jed was a chronic masticater.

314
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,046
- How'd you know?
- He'd go blind doing that.

315
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,614
How long did you
take care of the bird for, Owen?

316
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,701
Two or three months,
until it was strong enough

317
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,621
to go into Jed's room
and eat his gerbil, I guess.

318
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,042
But what happened to the hawk?

319
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
We set it free.

320
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,589
Oh. Okay.

321
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,952
That reminds me.

322
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,051
Remember when Colby
fell in the Gowanus Canal?

323
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,387
- Remember that day?
- Oh, poor Colby.

324
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,390
- I threw the stick, he didn't go for it...
- So traumatizing.

325
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,400
I told Jed I wouldn't marry him
until they painted you in.

326
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,028
Maybe that's why
we haven't set a date yet.

327
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,698
They're gonna paint me in.

328
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,993
The artist just took
a six-month sabbatical to Nepal,

329
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,286
to study the light.

330
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,414
I lost my job.

331
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,878
I'm sorry, Owen.

332
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,715
It's okay, I'll find a new one.

333
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,134
I'm actually thinking about becoming

334
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,887
a temporary volunteer husband.

335
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,305
You're not serious.

336
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,808
Get rid of my lease,
bounce from widow to widow.

337
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,934
Mm-mm.

338
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,732
Do you ever notice that your plans
always involve starting over...

339
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,069
often with an entirely new identity?

340
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,072
It's a good fantasy.

341
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,617
Pudding's upstairs
by the fireplace, everyone.

342
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,080
Just to get through
the post-dinner conversation.

343
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,839
Think about it.

344
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,884
Seriously...

345
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,346
as a hypothetical.

346
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,267
Say you and I left, right? Tonight.

347
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,771
I got us passports, new identities.

348
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,275
You steal all the money
from Jed's bank account.

349
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,111
We just... do that.

350
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,155
We get a house in the middle of nowhere.

351
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,031
Start again.

352
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,076
Different people.

353
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,995
Are we a married couple?

354
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,081
We don't...

355
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,919
We can be, you know...

356
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,798
We don't have to be. We could be
brother, or sister, or... friends.

357
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
So...

358
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,178
tonight, then,

359
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,014
after dessert?

360
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,724
Yeah.

361
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,644
I'm serious. Let's do it.

362
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,484
You're fucking with me.

363
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
I got you.

364
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,869
You believed me.

365
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,833
This week's gonna be a living hell for me.

366
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,837
He'll totally win.

367
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,924
He's not guilty.
No chance of a conviction.

368
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,177
It's all just so humiliating.

369
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,096
I mean, it's been going on
for fucking ages,

370
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,515
all just for one day in court.

371
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,143
Because he didn't do it, so...

372
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,688
You're positive?

373
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,524
Right? You were actually with him?

374
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,069
Yes.

375
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,303
- You would make that move.
- What does that even mean?

376
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,037
- "Make that move"?
- That's the move...

377
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,790
Hey, Owen, you're not trying
to sneak off, are you?

378
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,707
No, Dad.

379
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,959
I need a second of your time
before you leave.

380
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,629
Come on, boys, it's time.

381
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,507
- Balderdash!
- Oh!

382
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,676
- Owen, you're staying to play.
- No, I-I have to go.

383
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,012
- I have something...
- You love Balderdash.

384
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:09,930
No, I don't.

385
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,099
Come on, stay, it will be fun.

386
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,975
I have a fundamental problem
with Balderdash.

387
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,436
I gotta say,
what a delicious meal that was.

388
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
- Sure was.
- So good, Mom. So good.

389
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,148
- You used to love Balderdash.
- Oh, no, I didn't.

390
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,085
Who wants ice cream?

391
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,070
- Who wants ice cream? Oh, you do?
- I do!

392
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:29,324
Of course. But whoever's the quietest
gets ice cream, I promise. Mom.

393
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,035
Oh, are we playing Balderdash, or what?

394
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,248
So, um...
I've been considering...

395
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,291
Considering leaving Roosevelt Island?

396
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,626
- No...
- Oh, thank God.

397
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,462
So, have Hal help you find
something closer.

398
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,440
- Oh, you moving closer?
- I'm not moving closer.

399
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,092
Crazy to think that every word
did get invented.

400
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,010
I-I have to go. Goodbye.

401
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,680
- Wait, you're not playing Balderdash?
- No, I can't. Bye.

402
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,932
Oh, Owen, come on, you love Balderdash.

403
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,394
No, I don't fucking love Balderdash!
Balderdash is bullshit.

404
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,689
- Jesus, Owen.
- Is he off his meds?

405
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,029
I'll walk you to the station.

406
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,752
- Don't worry about Uncle Owen.
- Aggressive.

407
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,945
He's a spaz.
We're gonna get ice cream now.

408
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,198
<i>- Is it a money crisis?
- No.</i>

409
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,536
I know it's an expensive apartment
to rent, but...

410
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,790
Have you... have you thought about a...
a roommate?

411
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,874
No.

412
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,337
I don't know why you won't let us
just buy you a place.

413
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,131
That way you'd have more security.

414
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,510
Or you... you could come and work
for the company.

415
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,679
All your brothers do.

416
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,683
I already agreed, okay?

417
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,643
You don't need to buy me off.

418
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,314
Uh... I don't... I don't follow you.
What<i>...</i>

419
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,776
I will lie for Jed...

420
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,322
next week in court.

421
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,283
I get the expectation.

422
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,412
It's not an expectation, Owen,
it's a gift.

423
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,750
You are giving your brother
the gift of an alibi.

424
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,129
This woman is an opportunist.
She sees an in.

425
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,884
You're protecting him.

426
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,636
You're protecting the family.

427
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:19,935
I know, I know, it sounds muddled,
but that is the way reality works, Owen.

428
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,895
How's that, Dad?

429
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,189
With... with adjustments.

430
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,983
Just so you know, I got a new job.

431
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,987
Oh? What... what job?

432
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,615
Business... marketing.

433
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,869
It involves travel, so I'll be gone
a couple days next week,

434
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,913
but I'll be back in time for the trial.

435
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,248
And...

436
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,044
don't worry if you can't reach me.

437
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,506
Someone invented a new kind of ham.

438
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,715
Oh.

439
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,593
That's... that's wonderful, Owen.

440
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,762
That's... that's... that's great.

441
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,808
Milgrim men, we always come out on top.

442
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,394
Anyway...

443
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,276
All right.

444
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,736

Use the code phrase.

518
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>If you are an odd number,
please line up at the intake corridor.</i>

519
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,814
The pattern is the pattern.
I know it doesn't make sense.

520
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,234
It doesn't make sense to me either
right now, but it will.

521
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,737
Keep going forward.

522
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,030
Just reach out...

523
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,324
and make contact.

524
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:35,161
<i>All odd numbers,
line up by the intake corridor.</i>

525
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,300
What the fuck is wrong with you?

526
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,717
Sorry.

527
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,097
Robert.

528
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,474
Robert. Robert, wake up.

529
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,191
The odds are here.

530
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,067
Okay.

531
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,031
Let us complete this trial
with none of the old problems, sir.

532
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
Yes, Dr. Fujita.

533
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,662
None of the old problems.

534
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,452
As you enter the common room,

535
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,645
you will notice
there are numbers on the pods.

536
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,982
The pod numbers correspond
with the numbers on your lanyards.

537
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,442
Please go to your pod.

538
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,154
That will be your home for the duration
of your stay here with us.

539
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,865
Leaving your pod
at any unauthorized moment

540
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,202
will result in the termination
of your stay here at this trial,

541
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,497
as well as bringing shame
and humiliation upon you.

542
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,545
Once you reach your pod,
an orderly will approach

543
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,756
and begin to inspect your bag.

544
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,551
Once the orderly has inspected your bag,
you will put your bag in your locker.

545
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,887
Once you have done that,
make your way to this gentleman.

546
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,305
He will give you your uniform,

547
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,808
as well as your patented Neberdine shoes,

548
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,061
which you cannot take with you
at the end of the trial.

549
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,565
Once you have your uniforms
and your shoes,

550
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,567
you will make your way back to your pods,

551
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,530
then you will get in your pods
and change clothes in your pods.

552
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,824
There will be no changing in the commons.

553
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,285
Oh, my God!

554
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,954
Condoms are contraband.

555
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,373
- Safety first.
- That's a red flag right there.

556
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,584
Intimacy in this facility is off-limits.

557
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,630
There will be no cohabitation
inside the pods.

558
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,258
Once the curfew starts, lights go out.

559
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,926
You're not supposed to be here.

560
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,389
Please.

561
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,932
What are my instructions?

562
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,976
The pattern is the pattern.

563
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,228
You're my contact.
What are my instructions?

564
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,481
Please turn off the pattern.
Please turn off...

565
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,025
- Owen.
- ..tight schedule.

566
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,944
We will tell you when there is mealtime.

567
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,614
Your instructions are to go back
to your pod and await my signal.

568
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,927
...two Etch A Sketches and one
Lite-Brite. Please don't fight over them.

569
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,244
I'm going to save the world.

570
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,288
We will tell you
when there's recreation time.

571
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,914
- Yes.
- We will also tell you when...

572
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,792
- You're gonna save the world.
- And we will tell you when to sleep.

573
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,838
- But not if you blow our cover.
- ...expecting. Thank you.

574
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,548
Is that working for you?

575
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,757
Okay, I understand.

576
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,926
If you're having trouble
getting into your pod,

577
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,472
there is also a little ladder underneath
that will help you get into your pod.

578
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,641
Also note, from here on in,

579
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,978
you will be referred to
as the number on your lanyard.

580
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,104
You are the Odds.

581
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,231
Attention.

582
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:48,080
Please give your attention
to Dr. Muramoto and Dr. Fujita.

583
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,082
They will be supervising your trials.

584
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,213
Welcome, subjects.

585
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,757
You made the right choice.

586
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,844
It's time to start your lives again.

587
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,766
You don't fuck this up...

588
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,602
I won't fuck this up.

589
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,645
Just kidding.

1
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,163
You're the last one.

2
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,585
And then it is fuck you... forever.

3
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,841
A

4
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,172
<i>You have not lost.</i>

5
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,590
<i>There is a way.</i>

6
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>A way for you to hold in your hand
the power of the galaxy.</i>

7
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>What do you mean?</i>

8
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,682
<i>We thought to use...</i>

9
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,269
<i>all of this to conquer only Neptune.</i>

10
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,436
<i>But why?</i>

11
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,355
<i>Why merely Neptune?</i>

12
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:33,111
<i>That gives you the power
to control every planet in the galaxy.</i>

13
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,194
<i>Yes.</i>

14
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,113
<i>Yes.</i>

15
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,992
<i>Every planet in the galaxy.</i>

16
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:44,247
<i>I can penetrate into
the most secret chambers of the galaxy.</i>

17
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,615
Fuck you.

18
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,965
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS DOG?
"GROUCHO" VERY GENEROUS REWARD!

19
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,551
''Silken smooth,
and shiny, and soft,

20
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,012
these curls won't abandon you.

21
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,390
Creamazone means lasting hold
and definition.''

22
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,934
You ready for another one?

23
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,143
Do I have a choice?

24
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,979
Oh, your options with AdBuddies
are limitless.

25
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,440
Okay? That's what makes us
superior to PallyAds.

26
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,608
I was joking.

27
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,195
- "Not enough time...
- Wait, when you say "limitless"...

28
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,031
do you mean actually limitless?

29
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,594
Like, if I needed a bus ticket to Salt Lake
City and I brought you with me to pay for it?

30
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,580
I mean, not necessarily you, specifically,
but one of you...

31
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,708
to pay for the hotel and meals,
and the bus ticket back,

32
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,960
would that be possible?

33
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,338
No one's ever asked me that.

34
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,759
Well, it would require you
to view thousands of ads, but...

35
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:26,182
Yes, I suppose it could be possible.
If that was, um...

36
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,850
What?

37
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,938
Sounds like it might be kind of fun.

38
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,147
Yeah.

39
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,526
What's in Salt Lake City?

40
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,695
Um, my little sister.

41
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,572
I owe her a visit.

42
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,839
I'm gonna read you this time...

43
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,050
because I am healthy Annie now,

44
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,094
and healthy people read books...

45
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,639
and travel, and exercise...

46
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,100
and take care of their minds.

47
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,601
DON QUIXOTE

48
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,997
- Where's Jackie?
- She's in the shitter.

49
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,168
What the fuck? Did you take my money?

50
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,629
Yeah, I took your money.
You haven't paid rent in three months.

51
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,715
I haven't had a job in five months.

52
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,385
Well, maybe you should be
a little more goal-oriented.

53
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,140
Can I at least have 20 bucks?

54
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,018
Yes.

Hello?

71
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,225
Are you dead?

72
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,148
No.

73
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,358
Good.

74
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,571
You gonna come out today?

75
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,700
Your yard is a fucking mess.

76
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,663
"All things excellent

77
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,540
Mmm. Is that Rilke?

78
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,334
Spinoza.

79
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,335
I like it.

80
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,510
I just came by to tell you
I'm gonna go away for a while.

81
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,765
I was thinking about taking the bus
to Salt Lake, go see Ellie.

82
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,352
You could come.

83
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,523
We could go together.

84
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,859
Oh, I'm really busy right now.

85
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,325
Is the combination to the safe
still the same?

86
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,745
I just need to borrow a little bit
for my bus ticket.

87
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,747
I changed it.

88
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
To what?

89
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,875
Your birthday.

90
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,337
Got tired of thinking of your mother
every time.

91
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,133
Promise me you're gonna eat
while I'm gone?

92
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,427
I got you cereal.

93
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,264
Apple Jacks?

94
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,847
Of course.

95
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,354
Hey, maybe when I'm back
we could go to Totonno's for dinner.

96
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,230
Maybe.

97
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,069
Okay. Love you, Dad.

00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,491
You dirty motherfucker.

109
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,659
<i>Come on, bud.</i>

110
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,742
Calvin.

111
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,995
It was a one-time thing.

112
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,541
My dad had a mini-stroke
after I stole 'em.

113
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,085
Why do you even like that ULP shit?

114
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,045
- It's dark.
- So, what if I really,

115
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,132
really need some more,
however I can get it?

116
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,883
<i>I don't got all day here, pal.</i>

117
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,262
Sign up for a Neberdine study.
Help make my dad's company millions.

118
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,555
That's it, I just sign up?

119
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,265
- <i>That was pathetic.</i>
- No.

120
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,517
- They screen you.
<i>- Checkmate.</i>

121
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,728
You could be testing deodorant for a week.

122
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,187
I'm fucked.

123
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,543
- Just lost a hundred dollars.
<i>- What's yours is mine now, bitch.</i>

124
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,402
Hey. Hey, you're my friend.

125
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,695
Yeah?

126
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,698
- And can I say something, as your friend?
- Sure, yeah.

127
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,116
You sound like a junkie.

128
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,659
I'm not a junkie.

129
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,829
I'm a recreational drug user.
Like you, by the way.

130
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,874
- What is the name of the person at intake?
- I can't tell you that.

131
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,960
ULP's gotten way more secretive
since the suicides.

132
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,421
Give me a name.

133
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,797
<i>Gesundheit. Gesundheit!!</i>

134
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,089
<i>Rude.</i>

135
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,925
Lugo.

136
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,762
Patricia Lugo.

137
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
Patricia Lugo.

138
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Thank you.

139
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,267
<i>Nice friend.</i>

140
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,394
It's yours.

141
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,022
<i>Right into the eucalyptus fund.</i>

142
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,693
<i>Three hundred to get started.</i>

143
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,154
- To blackmail somebody?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,705
Okey-dokey.

145
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,166
Who's your target?

146
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,225
I can't read your handwriting.

147
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,520
Patricia Lugo.

148
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,902
She's the intake director
at Neberdine Pharmaceuticals and Biotech.

149
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,489
You going in and getting high
and robbing the place?

150
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,121
Patricia Lugo,
Nerberdine Pharmaceuticals Biotech.

151
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,875
She paid Zip Dox to have
her public arrest records scrubbed.

152
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,254
Zip Dox is Shit Dox. Easy to unscrub.

153
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,384
This is legal, right?

154
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,429
Think we'd have it on the storefront
if the Banner Act didn't make it legal?

155
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,513
Yes.

156
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,059
You gotta pay us more
than she paid Shit Dox.

157
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,142
Five hundred.

158
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,940
You get a free calendar.

159
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,998
Patricia Lugo. Gambling addict,
disorderly arrest in Atlantic City.

160
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,918
Lost custody of her daughter, Usnavy.

161
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,129
Goes to Hunter.

162
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,965
Good job, had it for 18 months.

163
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,008
Probably had records scrubbed
so she could get it.

164
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,761
You want
the whole skeleton-closet file?

165
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,723
I could threaten
to kidnap the daughter too.

166
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,141
No.

167
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,019
- That shit always works.
- No, it's fine. I don't...

168
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,938
- I don't want to harm her in any way.
- Uh-huh.

169
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,316
Okay.

170
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,363
Here's your calendar. Other options.

171
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,743
Volunteers at CP Center,
user of Friend Proxy,

172
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,412
pays way too much for luggage...

173
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,165
Wait, Friend Proxy?
Does she have appointments coming up?

174
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,708
Ah...

175
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
Interception.

176
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
Hm?

177
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,362
Patricia?

178
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,823
Juanita.

179
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,039
Oh!

180
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,082
Hey.

181
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,252
- It's so good to see you again.
- You too. You too.

182
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,048
You know, um,
every time I walk in this place,

183
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,258
I get pulled back into this room,
you know?

184
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,342
Oh, me too.

185
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,843
Me too.

186
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,085
I just love little trees.
I meant because of how we met.

187
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,811
- Right here.
- Sure.

188
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,271
- At the bonsais.
- Oh, yeah. That too. That too.

189
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,473
Do you remember that summer?
How much fun we had, right?

190
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh!

191
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,158
Running up and down Coney every day...

192
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,869
Eating icy pops.

193
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,665
Yeah, when we took the train,
with Uncle Liam.

194
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,837
Now, who the fuck is... Uncle Liam?

195
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,175
I'm sorry. I-I don't...
Do you want to start over or something?

196
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,636
Seriously? What, then, you new?

197
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,263
No. I'm...

198
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,931
What...? What's your rating?

199
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,059
'Cause you really don't have
a very good feel for people, honey.

200
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,439
You're using a service
that gives you pretend friends.

201
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,067
I have real friends.
This is just more convenient.

202
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,151
Mm-hmm.

203
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,070
Oh, you have friends?

204
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,867
You know what?
I don't even work for Friend Proxy.

205
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,201
All right?

206
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,371
I canceled your appointment,
and I am here to fuck up your life, lady.

207
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,790
I'm gonna blackmail the shit out of you.

208
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,333
What?

209
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,796
What? What are you
talking about? Who are you?

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,256
Forget it. I'm sorry.

211
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,261
- No, no, no, no, wait. Who are you?
- No, I'm really sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

212
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,104
Hey.

213
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,775
Can I sit with you?

214
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,322
I'm just trying to understand.

215
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,491
I'm a bit confused.

216
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,034
Am I a mark?

217
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,619
Yeah.

218
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,248
For what? I'm...

219
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,209
I'm broke.

220
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,921
I was trying to get into a study
at your work.

221
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,548
And I said I'm sorry,
so can you leave now, please?

222
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,466
Why?

223
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,929
- I really don't need...
- No, really, I'm asking you...

224
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,055
why?

225
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,558
Is this some AA shit?

226
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,685
I'm enjoying this pond.

227
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,773
You remind me of my little girl,
that's all.

228
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,152
If there's anything I can help...

229
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,530
So...

230
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,407
why?

231
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,415
Because I am addicted to a drug
that your company's testing.

232
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,002
That's not the "why" I'm asking.

233
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,047
What "why" are you asking?

234
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,431
Five years ago, my sister and I got into
a really bad fight.

235
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,227
Very, very bad.

236
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,313
And I can't fix it.

237
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:15,404
So there's this rock
that sits in my stomach, this cold rock.

238
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,907
Like a boulder, and it's just there...

239
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,451
all the time.

240
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,412
And I found this pill...

241
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,332
It helps me get through the day.

242
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,878
It's not hurting anyone.

243
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,091
And it makes me feel good. It is
the only thing that makes me feel good.

244
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,802
Have you tried talking to her?

245
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,095
I can't.

246
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,980
Why shouldn't I be able to take
a pill like that whenever I want?

247
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,525
You should, hon.

248
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,612
If it ain't hurting anyone.

249
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,404
Hmm?

250
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,795
Super happy.

251
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,302
Helpful.

252
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,142
Togetherness.

253
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,518
You don't have to rush.

254
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,186
Okay.

255
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,355
Sorry.

256
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,986
Sisters.

257
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,907
Making faces at each other.

258
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,534
It's supposed to be an emotion.

259
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,745
What you feel.

260
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,121
Fine.

261
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,504
Now, please turn your attention to me...

262
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,465
as I ask you this final question.

263
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,448
The test is complete.

264
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,661
Please go back
to the reception area and wait.

265
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,744
Did I...?

266
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,748
Did I pass the test?
What was that last question?

267
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,128
I was telling the truth
about all those pictures.

268
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,297
- This test is not about the truth.
- Well, what is it about?

269
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,340
Defense mechanisms.

270
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,051
I don't have fucking defense mechanisms.

271
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,805
I think you should let me do it again.
Who's in charge of the red light?

272
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,934
I... I don't fucking understand because
I am supposed to be part of the trial.

273
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,018
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,855
This is fucking bullshit.

275
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,362
Patricia. Patricia.

276
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,614
No. No, no, no, no, no. No more favors.

277
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,950
I got bosses around. No more. Go.

278
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,425
- We had a deal.
- I said I could funnel you through ULP.

279
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,719
You failed the intake test.

280
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,346
It is out of my hands.

281
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,223
No, I have to get into that study,
Patricia.

282
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,599
All the way. I can't.

283
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,604
Move on, please.

284
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,818
There you go. Thank you.

285
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,661
Patricia, may I speak with you, please?

286
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,041
You have a daughter.

287
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,836
Her name is Usnavy,
and she goes to Hunter College.

288
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,048
And if you don't get me into that study,
you're never gonna see her again.

289
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,715
What?

290
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,594
Yeah, I know a guy who has a van,

291
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,722
and if anything happens to me,
he knows what to do.

292
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,641
You're fucking crazy.

293
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,851
I'm not fucking crazy, Patricia.

294
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,062
I'm just goal-oriented.

295
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Two minutes.

296
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,990
Go sit over there.

297
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>Owen Milgrim,
please report to DM Test Room five.</i>

298
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,421
<i>Owen Milgrim, please report
to DM Test Room five for ULP screening.</i>

299
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,427
What's the color?

300
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,346
This one's the same, that's...

301
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,306
Well, I guess it's kind of gray.

302
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,891
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hi.

303
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,352
I have some good news.
We're going to upgrade you.

304
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,311
Oh.

305
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,773
Just between you and me,
it's a much, much safer trial.

306
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,985
Okay. Um, does it have the same pay?

307
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,821
- You just hand this over to me.
- Okay.

308
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,824
And you can go and talk
to my colleague over there at the desk,

309
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,992
and sort it all out.

310
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,409
Okay.

311
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,623
So... so, what do you mean, "safer trial"?

312
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,707
It's fine.

313
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,799
Your daughter is safe.

314
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,842
For now.

315
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,324
<i>The human brain is vast as the cosmos,</i>

316
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,047
<i>and equally unexplored. We here at
Neberdine Pharmaceutical Biotech</i>

317
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,538
<i>are pioneering a revolutionary procedure</i>

318
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,625
<i>that will unlock
the secret mysteries of the mind,</i>

319
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,920
<i>and replace old-fashioned talk therapy...
forever.</i>

320
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,879
<i>Sorry, Sigmund.</i>

321
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,550
<i>Hello. I'm Dr. James K. Mantleray.</i>

322
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,470
<i>And I'm Dr. Robert Muramoto.</i>

323
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,515
<i>Welcome to Phase III of the ULP testing.</i>

324
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,976
<i>You are not only participants
in a pharmaceutical drug trial,</i>

325
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,063
<i>you are pioneers
at the forefront of a new world.</i>

326
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,941
<i>You may notice you're here
with 11 other subjects.</i>

327
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,610
<i>But don't worry, your experiences here,</i>

328
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,278
<i>likely very powerful,</i>

329
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,239
<i>will be private and discreet,</i>

330
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,823
<i>and entirely your own.</i>

331
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,701
<i>No one sees into your heads...</i>

332
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,121
<i>And the multiple fantasy cells
hiding inside there.</i>

333
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,456
<i>...but us.</i>

334
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,209
<i>Now you're probably wondering,
"How does it work?"</i>

335
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,335
<i>And it's simple.</i>

336
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,004
<i>Three pills taken in three steps...</i>

337
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:48,922
A B C

338
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,133
<i>...analyzed by the most sophisticated
mega-computer ever developed:</i>

339
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,135
<i>the GRTA.</i>

340
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,430
<i>Hello, friends.
I'm a smart computer.</i>

341
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,057
<i>After ingesting the pills,</i>

342
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,769
<i>the GRTA's cutting-edge
artificial intelligence</i>

343
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:07,774
<i>will identify, map, and confront
the learned programming of your brain.</i>

344
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,818
<i>At the end of this trial,</i>

345
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,738
<i>don't be surprised if you experience
pure, unaffected joy.</i>

346
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,033
<i>You'll be born again,
but not as a baby.</i>

347
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,161
<i>Now, let's take a closer look.</i>

348
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,456
<i>Pill A: The diagnostic stage.</i>

349
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,919
<i>Pill A seeks out your core traumas
and pulls them to the surface.</i>

350
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,879
<i>We call it Agonia.</i>

351
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:34,384
<i>Through your memories,
we'll see the worst moments of your life.</i>

352
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,512
<i>But don't worry... it's safe.</i>

353
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,390
<i>We observe, using powerful
microwave technology,</i>

354
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:45,228
<i>the known and unknown anchors of pain
in your personal history</i>

355
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,189
<i>in order to create an arborization map</i>

356
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,986
<i>that the GRTA will use as a guide
for pills B and C.</i>

357
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,905
<i>Pill B: Behavioral.</i>

358
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,283
<i>- Time to show your...
- Blind spots!</i>

359
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,202
<i>Unfortunately, the brain
is remarkably skilled</i>

360
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
<i>at protecting itself.</i>

361
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,874
<i>With the second pill, you can identify</i>

362
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,752
<i>self-defense mechanisms, blind spots,</i>

363
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,797
<i>and the mazes and walls
that your mind creates to hide yourself...</i>

364
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,591
<i>from you.</i>

365
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,427
<i>Finally, it's time for...</i>

366
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,095
<i>confrontation.</i>

367
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,015
<i>Pill C: Confrexia.</i>

368
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,978
<i>This is what has eluded psychoanalysts
since the discovery of the unconscious.</i>

369
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,729
<i>The end...</i>

370
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,815
<i>of the rainbow.</i>

371
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,194
<i>Confrontation and acceptance.</i>

372
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,155
<i>Once we've identified your core traumas</i>

373
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,658
<i>and mapped</i>
<i>your bio</i>-<i>psycho</i>-<i>social symptoms,</i>

374
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,202
<i>the GRTA mega-computer remaps</i>

375
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,372
<i>a more efficient system,

376
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,875

<i>non-surgical microwave technologies.</i>

378
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,590
<i>Welcome to the start of your new life.</i>

379
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,592
<i>Welcome to the start of your new life.</i>

380
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,261
<i>You will never be the same again.</i>

381
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,730
Any questions?

382
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,984
Good.

383
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,072
Even subjects, we'll provide you
with your pre-weighed meal,

384
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,242
as the odd-numbered subjects...

385
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,120
begin the trial.

386
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,124
Odd-numbered subjects,

387
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,209
I assume you know who you are by now,

388
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,755
please stand up, form a line,
and get ready to begin your trials.

389
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,884
As for the rest of you, please just
sit tight. We'll get to you soon.

390
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,566
Line up in order, please.
Number one in the front.

391
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,950
Everybody thought I was crazy,
but they were all wrong.

392
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,137
- All right.
- We'll talk about this later.

393
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,161
Number nine.

394
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,874
"I dried my tears and armed my fears

395
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,419
With ten thousand shields and spears.

396
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,672
Soon my Angel came again;

397
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,717
I was armed, he came in vain;

398
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,762
For the time of youth was fled,

399
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,891
And grey hairs were on my head."

400
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,648
<i>Oh, Robert, how poetic.</i>

401
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,485
I'm glad you like it.

402
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,945
<i>Oh, I loved it.</i>

403
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,451
<i>Now back I go, into their minds.</i>

404
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,668
One, three, five, seven, nine, eleven.

405
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,214
When you reach your seats,
you can put on your aprons.

406
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,398
- What's the vest for?
- Check number one's headrest.

407
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,427
It's like being at a dentist's office.

408
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,387
- What's the vest for?
- Precautionary.

409
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,223
Did they say anything about radiation?

410
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,306
Precautionary.

411
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,601
The vest protects your important parts

412
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,437
from the nominal amount
of residual headset radiation.

413
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,731
Can you check number one, please?

414
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,975
Final stages checks, please. - Cooling.
- Operational.

415
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,532
Electrical.

416
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,449
Stable.

417
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,659
Med profile.

418
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,370
- Uploaded and carved out.
- Take one of each.

419
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,581
I can see Gertie's safety net
is supple and responsive.

420
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,542
She liked what you read.

421
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,042
I know.

422
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,839
Take one of each.
Take one of each, please.

423
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,297
Wait!

424
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,592
Dr. Fujita will tell you
when you can take it.

425
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,973
A

426
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,692
The data we collect from our subjects,
in the next three days,

427
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,195
is absolutely vital
to the success of this trial.

428
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,990
What's more, their lives are in our hands.

429
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,658
No more mistakes.

430
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,091
Subjects, please ingest your pill
with your water.

431
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,146
GRTA

432
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,545
Visual check clear. Go to blue?

433
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,338
Going to blue.

434
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,348
Let's lay them down gently, people.

435
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,476
Hard entry is our enemy.

436
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,915
<i>Tank is full.</i>

437
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>Please remove nozzle.</i>

438
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,381
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

439
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,133
Think fast.

440
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,677
Oh.

441
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,553
There's 24,000 words in there.

442
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,680
What?

443
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,974
You know... picture?

444
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,683
Oh.

445
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,563
Twenty-four thousand... words.

446
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,065
Cute.

447
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,609
How many words is that?

448
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,527
One.

449
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,250
- Okay, '80s.
- There's a supernatural element.

450
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,127
Yep, but it has to make you cry.

451
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,255
- Oh, it's this one.
- Oh-oh. It's a body-switch movie.

452
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,382
He's him, and he's him.

453
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,385
And they crashed their dirt bikes
into each other,

454
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,762
they woke up in the hospital,
and they've switched bodies.

455
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,767
And the young one
has been masturbating constantly.

456
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,191
Now they're on this hijinks-filled
wackadoo road trip that ends with...

457
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:49,777
a secret sect of Utah businessmen...

458
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,487
that, um...

459
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,780
mmm...

460
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,115
practice soul-swapping.

461
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,594
I'm surprised you didn't add sodomy.
That's pretty light for you.

462
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,038
Well, I'm not finished yet.

463
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,416
It's tragic, because that old man
is now in this young body,

464
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,168
and he's gonna leave his grandson,

465
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,754
just ditch him,
and let him slip off into Alzheimer's.

466
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,006
There she is.

467
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm actually pissed about this.

468
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,010
Hey!

469
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,345
Hey!

470
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,431
I see you, motherfucker!

471
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,476
That wasn't your body in the first place!
You got to give it back!

472
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,227
You can't cheat Father Time!

473
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,990
Apparently in Colorado,
fast lane means slow lane.

474
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,493
Oh, my God! That's a bumpy road!

475
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,161
To the left.

476
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,956
To <i>your </i>left.

477
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:45,666
Okay.

478
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,750
Right now, it looks like you're sort of,
like, fondling the underside of it.

479
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,173
- I am not. What am I supposed to do?
- Just, like, give it some gumption.

480
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,008
- That's perfect. Like that?
- Yes!

481
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,218
Stay there. Stay.

482
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,426
One.

483
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,095
Two.

484
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,639
Three.

485
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,850
That's really funny.
Can I have the camera back, please?

486
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,934
No.

487
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,437
It's pretty.
I wanted to take a nice picture.

488
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,690
Well, I am the designated documentarian,
so no.

489
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,460
Yeah, I know. I gotta go.

490
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,921
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Love you too.

491
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,339
<i>See you soon, honey.</i>

492
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,966
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

493
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,651
I like this.

494
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,902
What?

495
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,950
Just... doing something with you.
I don't know, it's...

496
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,203
- It's been a while.
- Was that Mom...

497
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,330
that you were talking to just now?

498
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,375
No, that was Ben.

499
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,837
I just told him that we'd be there
by tomorrow night.

500
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,758
I just figured because you and Mom
have reconnected... or whatever.

501
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,807
I didn't reconnect with her, okay?

502
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,268
She wrote me a letter,
said it was an emergency,

503
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,686
that she needed something,

504
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,813
- so I called her back, once.
- Oh, my God.

505
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,274
- Here, take it. Read it.
- No. God.

506
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,835
- I'm not mad.
- I didn't say you were.

507
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,259
- Stop.
- I didn't say you were mad.

508
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,403
Let's watch a movie.

509
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,988
<i>Nothing to think over.</i>

510
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:39,906
Okay.

511
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,116
<i>They're trying to say that I'm in a gang.</i>

512
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,095
<i>- They think that I'm the leader of a gang.
- Well, you told them.</i>

513
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,872
<i>You waste his time and mine.</i>

514
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,792
- Oh, no, thank you.
- No, can we...?

515
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,753
Stop, I like this movie. I like it.

516
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,086
Leave it.

517
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,381
<i>He requires more serious...</i>

518
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,768
Annie's favorite.

519
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,520
I can't believe
you like this fantasy shit.

520
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,124
But it's real.

521
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:18,903
Annie, I'm Ellia,
your cursed Elven sister.

522
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,780
Rescue me.

523
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,282
From what?

524
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,159
From a normal life.

525
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,038
That is all on you.

526
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,626
Okay.

527
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,630
I've got a fantasy for you.

528
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,949
About a girl

529
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,972
moving her life to Salt Lake City,

530
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,684
because that's
where her fiancé has been transferred...

531
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,647
because she thinks it'd make her happy.

532
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,984
But she... But she's afraid...

533
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,279
of a nice family that stays together...

534
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,240
a nice job,

535
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,992
nice kids.

536
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,870
Afraid because maybe
she can't maintain that...

537
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,164
stability.

538
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,421
Maybe she'll just realize that isn't
what she wanted, and she'll just...

539
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,631
fuck it all up and...

540
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,967
her kids along with it.

541
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,011
But she doesn't.

542
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,347
It works.

543
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,310
It works out fine.

544
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,063
Sounds like a fantasy
of someone who gave up.

545
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,408
You have such a thing.

546
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,952
- A thing?
- Mm-hmm.

547
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,580
With, like, going eight levels too harsh.

548
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,041
- No, don't do that.
- Do what?

549
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,295
Don't guess what you think I think
and then say it like it's coming from you.

550
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,381
You don't think
that I have my own doubts, Annie?

551
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,225
You're so caught up
with your own narcissism.

552
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,029
- I'm sorry, my narcissism?
- The fact you can't take care of anything,

553
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,364
- or keep one relationship going.
- I'm sorry about your dog.

554
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,723
Your fucking Mom-like narcissism.

555
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,850
- I loved him too!
- Even the whole armpit pictures.

556
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,352
What point are you trying to make?

557
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:18,064
That I'm fucking stupid
for wanting to remember a nice trip?

558
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,108
Because I'm sad.
I'm sad that I'm moving away from you!

559
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,028
It's hard to talk to you
when you're this emotional.

560
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,824
You're the one acting like Mom.

561
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,994
You know, I have my things too, I just...

562
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,123
I just don't broadcast them to the world.

563
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,042
Is that what I do?

564
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,129
You also fucking lie constantly.

565
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:48,761
Every second, of every day,
of your entire fucking life

566
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,971
is broadcasting how normal you are.

567
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:55,476
You're so desperate for someone
to tell you you're okay.

568
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,190
I don't know how this started.

569
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,441
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,360
I was just trying to talk to you.

571
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:08,656
You don't have to shut down
just because I'm saying something real.

572
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,408
I'm not shutting down.

573
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,747
Can I say one last <i>real</i> thing?

574
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,464
Every time I think of New York,
without you in it...

575
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,801
This is seriously true, this isn't a lie.

576
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,554
...I feel happy.

577
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,601
Because now I won't have to feel bad
about not calling you,

578
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,728
or doing anything with you.

579
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,731
You'll be far away.

580
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:48,070
And we can grow apart...
and we won't have to pretend we didn't.

581
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,827
I'm gonna miss you too, Annie.

582
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,980
Do you want to take an actual picture?

583
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,107
Of both of us?

584
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,735
- I'm not stupid.
- What?

585
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,239
It's the perfect time
to fuck with me again.

586
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,659
No, I'm not fucking with you.
I'm not. I'm being serious.

587
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,076
Okay.

588
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,163
I do want to remember this.

589
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,168
My... The camera is in my bag.

590
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,677
Here, I'll take it.

591
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,596
- Hold the wheel.
- Okay.

592
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,225
They should have, like, a stick
for something like this.

593
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,308
Three.

594
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,726
Two.

595
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,031
- One.
- That's so annoying.

596
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,606
That was fucking funny.

597
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,483
No, it's not funny anymore.

598
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,606
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

599
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,819
- Annie... No, I bought it.
- Ellie, stop. Come on.

600
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:17,034
- I did take a picture of my armpit.
- Why won't you take the picture?

601
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,179
Welcome back, subjects.

602
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,390
Welcome back.

1
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,117
Ten seconds until reentry, people.

2
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,077
Here they come.

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,086
Welcome back, subjects.
Welcome back.

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,466
Huh?

5
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,343
What was that?

6
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,095
It was fucking unethical.

7
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,389
You waived ethics in your consent form.

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,033
Talk to me. Are we liking what
we're seeing on the neuromatrices?

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,644
Clean narrative data
from all but Subject One.

10
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,730
I'm not positive
he was actually down.

11
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,375
- What about Nine?
- I don't know what to tell you.

12
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,194
Brain structure tells me
she's been there many times before.

13
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,488
She's already got the grooves
of this narrative.

14
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,074
That was, uh... overwhelming.

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,035
- Wait till you take the second one.
- Friendly reminder,

16
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,623
please do not discuss your experience
with any other subjects.

17
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,126
Post-phase evaluations
will occur in ascending order,

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,587
so please settle in
and wait comfortably in the commons

19
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,255
until your number is called.

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,221
Mr. One, please report
to the post-exam test room.

21
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,430
Thank you.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,434
Please describe

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,480
your emotional state
upon waking from the pill.

24
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,650
Um... Fragile.

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,570
Maybe sad.

26
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,197
Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,736
Also hungry. You need snack?

28
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,536
Bleeding.

29
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,080
Emotional state.

30
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,956
Emotions.

31
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,998
Bleeding.

32
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,169
Internally.

33
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,546
You look tired.

34
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,715
I'm exhausted.

35
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,136
And devastated.

36
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,222
But satisfied.

37
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,394
I want to know more about the second pill.

38
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,104
Why?

39
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,108
I just do.

40
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,446
Um...

41
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,868
S... I'm speechless.

42
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,497
Anything else?

43
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,086
I'm speechless.

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,130
<i>I'll trust you too.</i>

45
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,214
<i>I won't count it.</i>

46
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,637
For me, it was a hurricane.

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
Horrible.

48
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,141
1999.

49
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,309
It took my Herbert.

50
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,311
You like the complicated ones, I see.

51
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,647
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
- It wasn't the best of marriages.

52
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,667
- I don't even know her.
- Are any of them?

53
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,152
- Nothing to be ashamed of.
- Don't say that.

54
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,738
These places all end up like camp.

55
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,616
Everyone falls in love in two hours.
It can get silly.

56
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,118
- You haven't remarried?
- I would never.

57
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,121
I was on a Phase I
of a GI treatment in Houston,

58
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,624
one of the rats proposed
on the second day.

59
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,545
Of course, by that time
we all had the radioactive shits.

60
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,088
You know what was odd though?

61
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,384
What the pill made me see
was not like I remember it.

62
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,556
Was that a memory,
or was it... something else?

63
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,683
One, Five, Nine.

64
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,854
Dr. Muramoto wants to see you
in his office.

65
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,528
- We've been red-flagged.
- What does that mean?

66
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,786
I do 20, 30 of these a year
all over the country.

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,497
It's good money
if you can work the system.

68
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,918
When they call you in right away,
that means they caught something.

69
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,339
What do they usually do?
Enhanced interrogation?

70
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,634
Enhanced interrogation?

71
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,134
No.

72
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,056
They red flag you, they mark your file,
they ask you a bunch of questions.

73
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,684
They're gonna document the case
so they don't have to pay.

74
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,978
- Then they kick you out.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

75
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,021
Every time,
it doesn't matter what you say.

76
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,274
Mr. Five, come in.

77
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,658
We're fucked.

78
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,079
I didn't take the pill
in case you needed to activate me.

79
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,503
Owen...

80
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,757
I'm sorry...

81
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,969
about what I said earlier. I...

82
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
sort of...

83
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,183
I kind of lied to get into the study,

84
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,060
and it seemed like you might be a problem,

85
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,854
so I just said what you needed to hear.

86
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,444
But you knew my name.

87
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,948
I saw you in the ads.
You said there was a larger pattern.

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,954
Well, I knew your name because
they said it on the intercom at reception.

89
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,168
And the ads, I sold my face

90
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,920
to a stock service four years ago,
so it's...

91
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,883
And...

92
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,471
as far as I can tell, there is no plan
or pattern to the universe.

93
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,597
It's just chaos.

94
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,973
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,270
Why are you here?

96
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,229
Your turn.

97
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,110
Yo, can I get my condoms back?

98
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,197
You don't get those condoms back.

99
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,158
Really sorry for the confusion.

100
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:18,086
There are inconsistencies
with your participation in this study.

101
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,963
Oh, okay.

102
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:25,051
And I'm gonna need you
to recount what happened in your mind

103
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,552
after taking the pill,

104
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:31,599
and verify your experience
of your core trauma.

105
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,686
It's supposed to be
the worst day of your life, right?

106
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,856
Is that what you experienced?

107
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,570
It was intense.

108
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,616
Describe intense... with details.

109
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,955
Well, when I took the "A" pill...

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,751
the light changed...

111
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,880
and I was standing

112
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,465
in my parents' house.

113
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,549
Gimlet?

114
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,593
Oh, what's that?

115
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,345
It's a gimlet.

116
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,056
Thanks.

117
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,766
<i>It was seven months ago,</i>

118
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,726
<i>my brother's engagement party,</i>

119
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,480
<i>and I had just switched
to a new medication.</i>

120
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,277
You like her, don't you?

121
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,615
Yeah, Adelaide's great.

122
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,619
I mean, you <i>really </i>like her.

123
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,954
What do you want, Jed?

124
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,251
Listen, I... I wanted to...
I wanted to ask you directly,

125
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,836
you know, because sometimes...

126
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,965
You're gonna help me out, right?

127
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,092
So long as you didn't do it.

128
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,303
I did... I didn't do it. God...

129
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,055
Nice to meet you.

130
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,391
It really doesn't matter
what happened, right?

131
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,602
You of all people would understand that.

132
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,813
Of course it matters.
It's the only thing that matters.

133
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,565
- Oh, what's real matters?
- Yes.

134
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,736
Okay. Hilarious. Hilarious, but okay.

135
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,946
Can I ask you something?

136
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,408
Can you imagine what Mom and Dad would do

137
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,660
if they found out
you had another incident?

138
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,831
Maybe write threatening letters
to very powerful people.

139
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,001
The mayor, the head of the FBI,
Secret Service.

140
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,588
Tell them how you see a pattern
in the universe,

141
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,424
and how you have to take 'em down
before it's too late.

142
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,969
Maybe sprinkle a little anthrax in there.

143
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,555
You can't do that.

144
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,310
I'm joking.

145
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,938
I'm joking. Jesus, lighten up.

146
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,232
Who said I'd do that, right?

147
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,483
But seriously...

148
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,695
someone could do that to you, right?

149
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,366
With your history,
you'll end up in the fuckin' loony bin.

150
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,868
It's like someone making up
whatever they want about me,

151
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,370
and I end up humiliated.

152
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,288
And it didn't even happen.

153
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,749
We're in the same boat.
You see that, right?

154
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,545
Anyway, I love you.

155
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,295
Yeah.

156
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,675
I wouldn't want that to happen
to anyone in our family.

157
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,469
I gotta go make a speech.

158
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,137
Yikes!

159
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,222
Wish me luck.

160
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,314
Dad.

161
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,441
Oh, there he is.

162
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,529
Um, listen.
Hey, everyone, thank you for...

163
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,364
Where are you hid...?
Don't hide. Come here.

164
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,824
Thank you everyone for coming.

165
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,078
Um, I would like to make a toast
to Adelaide, my Hempstead hamster.

166
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,955
- That's in the bedroom, right?
- Okay, stop.

167
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,294
But, um, I don't know if you guys heard,
she's engaged to be my... my bride.

168
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,673
I don't deserve her, that's for sure.

169
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,718
She doesn't deserve this,
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

170
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,054
- What are you gonna do?
- Dad, you're the man. Start it up.

171
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,149
Owen.

172
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,072
Owen!

173
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,952
Owen!

174
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,913
Owen!

175
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,460
So Sting was at this party?

176
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,423
No, he was singing Sting.

177
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,634
Did you make up that story?

178
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,554
No, I did not.

179
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,389
According to our readings,

180
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,308
you were conscious, Mr. One.

181
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,062
You did not take the pill.

182
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,898
No, that's... that's not possible.

183
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,923
Now, you are going to take that.

184
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,718
- I already took it.
- Don't lie.

185
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,428
If you don't take it,

186
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,807
I'll have security escort you
from this facility,

187
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,976
with no money,

188
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,394
no honor,

189
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,313
just shame.

190
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,730
No.

191
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,612
- Take it now.
- No.

192
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,281
I said take it.

193
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,825
No.

194
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,662
Drink.

195
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,602
Swallow!

196
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,907
Why were you in there so long?

197
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,408
What'd he say?

198
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,455
Could you tell Miss Nine
to come in, Mr. One?

199
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,209
He wants you to go in there.

200
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,426
<i>I don't know how
you had access to the pill,</i>

201
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,808
but analysis of the biodata indicates
that you have been using it compulsively.

202
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,274
I haven't.

203
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,782
I sympathize with you.

204
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:31,787
The "A" experience, on its own,
can be a seductive demon.

205
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,873
What are you talking about?

206
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,333
Most people wouldn't understand

207
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:41,505
why someone wants to revisit a trauma
again and again,

208
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,549
even take pleasure from it.

209
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,553
Most people, wouldn't.

210
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,554
But you do.

211
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,021
People like that
don't want to move forward.

212
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,607
I don't deserve to.

213
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,484
Don't you?

214
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,778
I want to move forward.

215
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,658
I want to know what the second pill does.

216
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,621
People who feel they deserve loss...

217
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,874
might try to move forward.

218
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,919
They might taste recovery...

219
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,007
but they always end up going back.

220
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,720
Why?

221
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,555
Be...

222
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,442
Dr. Muramoto?

223
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,611
Is...

224
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,404
Is this...

225
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,031
part of...?

226
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,493
Is this a test?

227
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,624
Or is that the test?

228
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,127
You wanna see if I'll answer it?

229
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,967
I can wait.

230
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,054
I'll wait forever.

231
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,605
Are you actually dead?

232
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,026
Fuck!

233
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,862
Owen, I need your help.

234
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,865
- What?
- Just get the fuck in here!

235
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,666
Do not let anyone come in this door.

236
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,211
- Did you kill him?
- No, I didn't fuckin' kill him.

237
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,337
He just died.

238
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,506
Sometimes people just die.

239
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,094
He made me take a pill.

240
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,721
What'd you see?

241
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,806
Olivia.

242
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,894
- We were studying.
- Is that your girlfriend?

243
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,812
No.

244
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,188
It's a girl I liked.

245
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,983
She asked me to help her
with her, uh, history finals.

246
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,318
I, like, wanted to talk to her
all semester.

247
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,447
And I was on my way to the library,
and I saw him.

248
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,615
Grimsson.

249
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,701
That was the first time
he ever came to me.

250
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,078
And he told me to watch out for Olivia,

251
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,622
and I just realized she was a plant.

252
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,626
My parents had paid her
to pretend to like me.

253
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,254
They were listening in.

254
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,007
My brothers were listening in.

255
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,925
They were just laughing at me.

256
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,013
My mind kept racing.

257
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,266
Like, someone had given her
information on me.

258
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,895
How she was getting paid

259
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,522
for every minute she made me happy...

260
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,071
and that my parents
paid her to marry me...

261
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,364
and grow old with me...

262
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,451
and have a family and seven kids.

263
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,539
I started asking her
if her name was even... Olivia.

264
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,168
And... she's like, "Are you okay?"

265
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,796
I said, "No, I'm not okay.
None of this is real.

266
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,801
None of this is real.

267
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,970
None of this is real."

268
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,522
Sounds like you were having a day.

269
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,815
What?

270
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,822
That's what my mom used to call it
when she got her wires crossed.

271
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,199
Doctors called it a BLIP.

272
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,368
Brief and limited psychosis.

273
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,036
I didn't know that.

274
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,038
I...

275
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,751
I just started screaming at her.

276
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,422
I just yelled
some fucked up things at her.

277
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,761
And other people started looking at me,

278
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,430
and I started throwing books at them
and screaming at them.

279
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,311
And I knew I was right.

280
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,605
I was so sure I was right.

281
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,946
Have you ever just felt unbelievably sure

282
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,824
that you were right
and everyone else was wrong?

283
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,744
All the time.

284
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,126
I'll do yours.

285
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,672
Where did you end up?

286
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,719
Strapped to a gurney
in a little room by myself...

287
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,389
screaming for my mom.

288
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,019
That's rough.

289
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,157
Let's go back out there and pretend
nothing fucked up happened.

290
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,621
The food cubes being distributed
during Meal Time

291
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,124
deliver a specific amount
of nutrients and calories to the body.

292
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,376
That means that your plates
at the end of Meal Time

293
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,045
need to be happy plates.

294
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,339
Does everyone know what a happy plate is?

295
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,007
A happy plate is a clean plate.

296
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,427
I can't eat.

297
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,178
You have to.

298
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,515
It's not to make me happy,
but to make science happy.

299
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,894
Tastes like the inside
of my cat's uterus.

300
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,313
Stay out of your cat's uterus.

301
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,522
Is this food?

302
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,152
Tell me why the pill
was so important to you

303
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,863
that you lied to get in here
and you tricked me.

304
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,368
I never would have messed with you
if I knew all that stuff had happened.

305
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,244
The BLIP.

306
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,623
It's okay. It's not your fault.

307
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,173
My sister and I were in a car crash
five years ago.

308
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,969
The driver passed out
behind the wheel of a semi-truck.

309
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,054
He had been driving for 30 hours.

310
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,681
He was high on NoDoze.

311
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:12,854
His name was Greg F.U.N. Nazlund.

312
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,440
His middle name was "fun."

313
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,737
It was his fucking fault
if we're talking about fault.

314
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,202
Every time I take that pill,

315
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,246
I have to live through
the worst day of my life,

316
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,372
just like you did.

317
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,625
I have to hear myself say the worst...

318
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,004
ugliest things I've ever said to anyone.

319
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,383
And it ends with the worst thing
that ever happened.

320
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,429
I fucking love it.

321
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,931
Why?

322
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,561
Because I get to be with her.

323
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,692
Oh, they found him.

324
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,031
<i>I thought he was napping
when I first came in.</i>

325
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,199
Poor Robert.

326
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,372
It's a catastrophe.

327
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,377
Want me to bring in a team,
get him out of here?

328
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,296
No. Leave him.

329
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,427
I have to go up to the 77th floor.

330
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,656
It was a past life.

331
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,325
An old life.

332
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,037
Lies forced us apart...

333
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,999
and now we can't remember.

334
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,419
No... I remember.

335
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,421
We were lovers.

336
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,175
Now we're gonna be together forever.

337
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,891
High Priestess of Atlantis...

338
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,143
can you feel that?

339
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,562
My energy in your chest?

340
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,689
I can feel it.

341
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,732
Good.

342
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,277
- Now, put your hands on me.
- Okay.

343
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,792
That's excellent.

344
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,445
- See what she does with a ping-pong.
- She shot them...

345
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,606
It was cute, but I wasn't into it,
y'know?

346
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,359
- Why weren't you into it?
- It was weird.

347
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,954
Fabulous.

348
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,166
That's good. That's good.

349
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,418
That's good.

350
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,128
Oh, that's... excellent.

351
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,255
James.

352
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,360
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- That's excellent.

353
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,387
- Oh, that's excellent.
- James!

354
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,270
I'm sorry to...

355
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,564
to walk in on you like this, but...

356
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,607
I still have my key.

357
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,947
I thought we had agreed...

358
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,076
that you wouldn't bother me
while I was working.

359
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,663
I need your help.

360
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,767
The very fact that you braved
the outside world for me

361
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,293
tells me this is an emergency.

362
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,064
Let me guess. You're having trouble
dampening the reality test

363
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,339
when it drops to NREM 3.

364
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,718
Now Dr. Muramoto has begged you
to come and beg me

365
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,678
- to come help him.
- He's dead.

366
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,099
He was freebasing an A/C mixture.

367
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,975
Uh<i>-</i>huh.

368
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,064
And who's going to replace him?

369
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,649
You.

370
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,405
- Don't fuck with me, Azumi.
- I'm not, James.

371
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,701
We need your help to finish.

372
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,207
Of course I'll need several minutes
to get my affairs in order, but...

373
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,584
yes.

374
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,131
I'll be right outside.

375
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,522
When is this fucking horse gonna die?

376
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,132
I don't have my security card.

377
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,224
Thank you for braving
the outside world for me.

378
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,560
Thank you for inventing this treatment.

379
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,567
Does Gertie know I'm here?

380
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,320
I haven't had a chance to tell her yet.

381
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,896
Hello.

382
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,732
It's...

383
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,404
excellent to see you again.

384
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,948
<i>James.</i>

385
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,243
<i>What a nice surprise!</i>

386
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,662
Are you gonna show your face?

387
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,416
All right.

388
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,087
Oh...

389
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,220
By the way, I thought you should hear it
from me first that Dr. Muramoto is dead.

390
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,596
<i>Oh!</i>

391
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,765
And I'm once again at the helm of this...

392
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,058
project.

393
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,019
<i>I see.</i>

394
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,730
<i>Thank you for telling me.</i>

395
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,873
Did Muramoto have access
to a beta headset?

396
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,833
Yes.

397
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,503
Sometimes he used it
when they were red flags. Why?

398
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,965
I'll address the subjects tomorrow myself.

399
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,051
They can't be spooked by a death.

400
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,134
And sometimes the arrival
of a new authority figure

401
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,555
could be equally upsetting.

402
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,473
Either is a data taint.

403
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,767
Last thing we want is a data taint.

404
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,518
Yeah.

405
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,396
We need all the data we can get.

406
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,315
Number Five...

407
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,403
he just brought rubbers, so...

408
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,447
he can stay, right?

409
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,911
Azumi.

410
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,288
Yes.

411
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,752
When an addict dies,
do you think it's suicide?

412
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,257
I believe Robert was optimistic.

413
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,554
I think he just made a mistake.

414
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,438
I'm sorry about Robert.

415
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,608
How are you feeling?

416
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,152
<i>I feel...</i>

417
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,948
<i>I have all the feels.</i>

418
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,158
Behavioral tomorrow.

419
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,870
What do you think
they'll all see in themselves?

420
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,439
<i>I don't know.</i> Get some rest.

421
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,993
Good night, Azumi.

422
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,709
Good night, James.

423
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,394
- What's wrong with fish sauce?
- There's nothing wrong with fish sauce.

424
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,558
Good morning.

425
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,896
Could I have everyone's attention
for a moment?

426
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,569
My name...
is Dr. James K. Mantleray.

427
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:37,909
Unfortunately, Dr. Muramoto
has had a family emergency,

428
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,120
so I will personally be assuming
oversight duties

429
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,955
of this iteration of the ULP.

430
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,501
Uh, I believe in this treatment.

431
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,172
And I believe in the idea
that we can all be...

432
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,424
uh...

433
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,051
fixed.

434
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,137
Pain...

435
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,057
uh, can be destroyed.

436
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,144
But it can't without trials
like this, so...

437
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,858
I guess I want to thank you all
for being the brave explorers...

438
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,069
that you are.

439
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,866
Uh, great adventurers on the precipice of
mankind's last, great, hidden frontier:

440
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,291
Mindlantis.

441
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,072
I'm seeing soothing
from the white.

442
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,782
Good. They're settling in.

443
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,952
And there's no reason
for any of them to be nervous.

444
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,912
Exposure elements stacked and loaded?

445
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,996
Affirmative.

446
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,790
Safety Net confirm.

447
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,625
Gertie is present and caring.

448
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,008
Okay, people,
let's illuminate some blind spots.

449
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,675
Azumi.

450
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,932
I'd like to administer
the behavioral pill.

451
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,310
It's been a while.

452
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,605
Be my guest, Dr. Mantleray.

453
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,070
Subjects, please ingest the pill.

454
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,815
All clear.

455
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,662
Going to green.

456
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,933
<i>...comes down to the butter.</i>

457
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,994
<i>- Everyone will tell you to bake...</i>
- Bruce?

458
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,019
<i>...with unsalted butter,</i>

459
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,021
<i>- but I tend to disagree...</i>
- Brucie?

460
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,825
<i>...because using salted butter
in the mix...</i>

461
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,856
Bruce?

462
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,278
You fell asleep in front of the TV again.
You got to get up.

463
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,904
<i>Okay, and...</i>

464
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:06,242
<i>Well, I know we're all worried
about our cholesterol these days,</i>

465
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,536
<i>but if you truly are...</i>

466
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,624
Hey.

467
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,710
Hey.

468
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,004
Is there any coffee?

469
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,089
Yeah, I just made some.

470
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,052
Big day today.

471
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,680
You say that every morning.

472
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,598
Well, today I mean it.

473
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,560
Toss? Keep?

474
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,312
Keep.

475
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,816
I'm saving it.

1
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,943
SEE HER SEE YOU SEE WE
DR. GRETA MANTLERAY

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,214
HOST OF 150 MINUTES WITH GRETA

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,101
All right, Dr. Greta,
let's fix this marriage.

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:20,978
Hmm.

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,611
SHE'S OFTEN TELLING YOU WHAT SHE NEEDS.

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,948
YOUR JOB AS HER HUSBAND IS TO HEAR IT.

7
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,495
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,419
NOW SERVING

9
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,378
Oh, that's me.

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,797
Excuse me.

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,175
Excuse me. That's me.

12
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,644
Oh, uh, that's okay.

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,730
I'm gonna wait for her. You go ahead.

14
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,861
How can I help you, dear?

15
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,988
I am here to report a dangerous driver.

16
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,200
This is form DS-7, including my anecdote.

17
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,410
My kids play on that street.

18
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,330
You don't have the name and address
of the driver.

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,290
Well, if I had his name and his address,

20
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,418
I'd go over to his house
and I'd have dealt with him myself.

21
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,504
You really shouldn't do that.

22
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,256
This is his license plate number.

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,092
Can you get any stuff from that?

24
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,678
Well, I'm not allowed
to give you that information, hon,

25
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,389
but I could file a report.

26
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,395
I don't know if you really wanna
bother with this,

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,564
because they take such a long time.

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,861
Yeah, I'm seeing his address now,
so I can submit this thing.

29
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,945
You know what?

30
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,032
Now that I'm here actually doin' it,

31
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,408
I feel like a snitch.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
And I ain't one.

33
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,121
But thanks. You've been helpful.

34
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,635
How'd it go?

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,265
Failed the written again.

36
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,892
I'm sorry, babe.

37
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,226
Next time.

38
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,688
Hey, wanna get a doughnut
at Lucky's or somethin'?

39
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,652
No, I wanna go to 534 Ashton Place.

40
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,529
You don't need a map.

41
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,198
You married Magellan.

42
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,491
Uh-huh.

43
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,742
Hey...

44
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,454
what baby wants, baby gets.

45
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,334
Fudgin' seat belt.

46
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,878
- You okay? - Yeah, it's stiff. You know.
- Go all the way back... - Yeah.

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,757
- ...and pull it.
- No, I know.

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,051
534 Ashton Place.

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,096
On a need-to-know basis.

50
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,058
Eight minutes, tops.

51
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,519
Oh, in your dreams, Bruce.

52
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,689
I'm gonna put it on sport mode,
Mario Andretti...

53
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,943
- Oh!
- There we are. There we are.

54
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,321
All right, eight minutes.

55
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,072
We did it.

56
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,699
- Perfect!
- Okay.

57
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,951
I'm just a guy

58
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,475
- who knows his way around.
- Ooh, Brucie, pull there.

59
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,079
- Here?
- Park there.

60
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,333
Okay.

61
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,503
Here we go.

62
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,130
Them sons of bitches.

63
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,882
Wait.

64
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,639
When we go in there,
you're gonna distract them.

65
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
What? Distract who?
The guys in the store, Bruce.

66
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,897
It's August, it's 98 degrees.

67
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
Why are we going to a fur store?

68
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,526
Just... Go on. Here, go ahead. Go.

69
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,073
It's a different guy.
It's not them.

70
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,449
He's a salesperson.

71
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,660
Welcome to Furs by Sebastian.

72
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,118
I'm him.

73
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,454
How can I help you today?

74
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,872
Uh...

75
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,002
I'm... I'm looking for something to wear...

76
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,005
uh, to the opera.

77
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,632
Is your bathroom in the back?

78
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,883
Oh, right here, hon.

79
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,760
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- Uh...

80
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,304
- Where... Where are... uh...
- You're just in time.

81
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,348
Our summer sale is just ending.

82
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,142
Take a look over here.
See what speaks to you.

83
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,647
I think you'd look
really stunning in a mink.

84
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,818
You don't choose a fur. It chooses you.
Take a look.

85
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,830
Hold on, Lance. I'm sendin' a fax.

86
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,676
PRIVATE

87
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,598
Wendy!

88
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,601
Hey, girl.

89
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,021
We're gonna get you out of here.

90
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,023
Oh, good girl. Come on.

91
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,161
Sam Beckett.

92
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,124
What a babe.

93
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,707
Oh, my God.

94
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,754
That's one way to lose five pounds.

95
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,089
Oof. Shut the door.

96
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,175
Oh, it fuckin' stinks, Lance.

97
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,258
Light a match.

98
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,261
What kind of car you drivin' out there?

99
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,679
It's, uh...

100
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,014
It's a... it's a Volvo,

101
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,016
but at, uh, home I got a...

102
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Corvette.

103
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,604
Very nice. Very diverse.

104
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,522
It's a goof, it's fun. I don't know.

105
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,981
And, Lance...

106
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,527
you can't put the code for the door
on the door.

107
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,489
You see that? That's 20 fuckin' grand.

108
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,201
It's got 31 transverse rings on its tail.
Do you know how fuckin' rare that is?

109
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,369
It's not a hat yet.

110
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,537
- When's Dad guttin' that thing?
- Tomorrow.

111
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,791
We have rehearsal.
It's the only time Joey and Matt are free.

112
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,211
- Can't they learn the routine separately?
- You fuckin' kidding me?

113
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,505
This shit has to be coordinated.

114
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,464
Do you hear that?

115
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,467
It's the sound it makes
when it's hungry.

116
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,902
- I thought...
- Shut up, I'm right.

117
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,136
- Just give it a V8.
- What?

118
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,263
Seriously. It's an old trick.

119
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,975
No, the fridge.

120
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,147
No, pour it in a glass.

121
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,441
Do you want it to cut its little tongue?

122
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,027
Lemurs have very delicate inner systems.

123
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,823
And then just bring it over to me
because I made that up, shithead.

124
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,910
Bottoms up, funny guy.

125
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,620
Fucking foreskin.

126
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,789
Oh, that is good.

127
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,209
Now, let's try this, okay?
Five, six, seven, eight.

128
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,882
Crisp.

129
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,137
Let's see what you got, Lance.
Get your head in the game.

130
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,097
Finding your hips. Okay? Go!

131
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,890
One, two, three.

132
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,685
Hair. Kick, pull, change.

133
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,395
Down. Up.

134
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,938
I got a feeling about you.

135
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,358
You might be the kind of guy...

136
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,612
who might be interested
in bulletproof furs.

137
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,783
Is that something
that sparks your imagination?

138
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,909
Uh...

139
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,828
I don't know.

140
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,415
Comes in very handy.

141
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,669
- Honey, we have to go now.
- Oh, yeah. Uh...

142
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,381
Thank you. We'll think about it, really.

143
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,883
The sale's ending today.

144
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,260
Maybe your wife will let you
come back later?

145
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,386
- Hah.
- Oh.

146
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,180
You look better in leather.

147
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,765
- Now, honey.
- All right. Well, hey...

148
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,850
- thank you.
- Thank you.

149
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,477
We're open till eight.

150
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,937
- Come on.
- I... I'm gonna think about it. Sorry.

151
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,149
I gotta tell you,
I really liked the way I felt in that.

152
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,694
All right, Sheila,
we struck out again.

153
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,528
Back we go.

154
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,283
You need to spill it, babe.

155
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,576
Spill what?

156
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,162
What the hell is goin' on?

157
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,542
They have Wendy.

158
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,212
Who the fudge is Wendy?

159
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,379
Nan's lemur.

160
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,256
Who the fudge is Nan?

161
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,841
She... Remember?

162
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,511
The woman that I was taking care of
at work.

163
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,012
With stomach cancer.

164
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,972
Who died yesterday morning.

165
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,475
Hold on, rewind more.

166
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,187
I told you that Nan and I
had a special connection, right?

167
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,814
So yesterday, on her deathbed,

168
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,359
Nan tells the doctor to get out,

169
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,571
and she asks me to take her lemur
and deliver it to her daughter.

170
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,492
- Wasn't her daughter there?
- No, they're estranged, Bruce.

171
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,620
And Nan, that lemur
just meant so much to her,

172
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:02,166
and she wanted to give it to her daughter
as a gesture of reconciliation.

173
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,459
So...

174
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,089
you agreed to deliver a lemur...

175
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,093
- from a dying woman...
- Mm-hm.

176
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,513
- ...to her estranged daughter?
- Yes.

177
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,390
So these two guys

178
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,601
come into the hospice two days ago,

179
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,354
and they asked Nan to buy the lemur.

180
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,022
So Nan tells them to scram,

181
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,234
and then yesterday, Nan passes,
God rest her soul,

182
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,654
so I take Wendy, and I get ready
to go find the daughter,

183
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
but then, you know, my bladder.

184
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,618
And so I go in to pee at Bagel Boss
for two minutes.

185
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:43,124
Next thing I know, this fuckin' van
is screeching away, with Wendy.

186
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,967
And thank God
I got the license plate number.

187
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,878
- That is fudging disrespectful.
- It is.

188
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,089
- While you're peeing in Bagel Boss.
- I know.

189
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,260
And now, tomorrow morning,
they're gonna turn Wendy into a hat.

190
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,983
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

191
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,347
Because I fucked it up.

192
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,766
Like I always do.

193
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,395
- You didn't fudge it up.
- Oh.

194
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,649
You found it, just now.

195
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,028
And let's call the cops
and clear this whole thing...

196
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,530
No. Bruce, I can't call the cops.

197
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,198
This is an illegal lemur.

198
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,035
If they take her, they're gonna ship her
back to Madagascar.

199
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,705
Plus, Nan told me that it had to be me.

200
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,997
Only me.

201
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,292
She was very specific on that point.

202
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,504
I just...

203
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,588
Ugh.

204
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,136
We gotta break into that store.

205
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,095
Tonight. Really?

206
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,226
You're gonna help me?

207
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,771
- Of course I'll help you.
- Aww!

208
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,523
You don't think I'm bonkers?

209
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,028
That's why I married you, babe.
You're a force of nature.

210
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,489
Bless you.

211
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,492
There was a chinchilla in there.

212
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,160
Do I have anything in there?

213
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,204
A big beautiful brain,
that's all I see up there.

214
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,667
What did the Buddha say
when he walked up

215
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,544
- to the hot dog vendor?
- What?

216
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,881
Make me one with everything.

217
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,965
Okay.

218
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,926
Good night. Be good.

219
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,845
- Aw, I thought we were eatin' together.
- Oh, I'm late.

220
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,055
And I hate asparagus.

221
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,349
Me too. I just want to break it!

222
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,535
- All right.
- See, Lin, what I said about the modeling?

223
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,679
Lights out at eight, please.

224
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,771
- No!
- You're very cooperative.

225
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,981
Thank you for being so cooperative.

226
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,692
See you later.

227
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,403
Yeah. I'll pick you up.
And Vicky's good to watch the kids.

228
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,486
Okay, good.

229
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,532
- Don't forget my gym bag.
- Of course. Love you, babe.

230
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,784
- Hi, Mrs. M.
- Hi, Vick.

231
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,785
Thank you so much. Bye.

232
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,036
- Hi, Vicky.
- Hi.

233
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,413
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah.

234
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,374
Did you hear about
the restaurant on the moon?

235
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,708
No.

236
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,960
Great food,

237
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,420
no atmosphere.

238
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,755
<i>"...and they would lure him back.</i>

239
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,358
- When they did..."
- That's a good one.

240
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,008
"...they would find out once and for all

241
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,720
if his exceptional madness
could be cured."

242
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,724
It's a good one today, huh?

243
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,475
I like it.

244
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,897
I know it's hard losin' a roommate,

245
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,108
and Nan was quite a lady.

246
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,237
It's gonna take a while
to feel normal again.

247
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,699
Actually, I haven't felt this good
in years.

248
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,452
Whenever I see Nan's empty bed,

249
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,245
I am just elated.

250
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,206
- Elated?
- Oh, I'm not happy she's dead.

251
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,501
I'm just happy it was her and not me.

252
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,921
Good night, Harriet.

253
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,589
Good night.

254
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,135
- You've got to fix the...
- How we doin' today, Mr. Ludlow?

255
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,237
- Good.
- You feelin' good?

256
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,471
Nick takin' care of you?

257
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,100
- Have you gotten a chance...
- Oh, Linda.

258
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,019
This gentleman wants to talk to you.

259
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,273
- Agent Lopez, New York Fish and Wildlife.
- Mm.

260
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,733
Do you have a second?

261
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,067
Yes, of course I can.

262
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,111
- Sure, yeah.
- Visiting hours in the afternoon...

263
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,780
Uh, Linda...

264
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,031
- Marino.
- Marino.

265
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,657
Yeah. Are you a cop?

266
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:04,992
Sort of.

267
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:09,288
I mean, there's not much of a difference,
authority-wise.

268
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,663
Okay.

269
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:16,212
You, uh, took care of a patient recently,
Nancy Walton.

270
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,005
Nan, yeah.

271
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,924
Uh, Nan, exactly.

272
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,635
You spend a lot of time with Nan?

273
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,180
- She was my patient, so...
- Mm-hm.

274
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,893
You know she had a ring-tailed lemur,
went by the name of Wendy.

275
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,814
Yeah, she kept it in a cage under her bed.

276
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,357
Where's that lemur now?

277
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,401
<i>Carol
to the nursing station.</i>

278
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,485
I don't know.

279
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,696
I mean, I have no idea, actually.

280
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,532
To be frank, ma'am,

281
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,326
there's a zesty black market
for that type of animal.

282
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,078
Cartels, what have you.

283
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,037
Oh, yeah, I bet.

284
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,332
And it's our job
to assure the lemur's safety.

285
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,250
Of course.

286
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,295
Make sure it's reunited
with its family... in Madagascar.

287
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,881
<i>Linda Marino, you're needed at Emergency.</i>

288
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,008
Family is very important.

289
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,177
I gotta go. I'll see you around.

290
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,804
And Nan's roommate Harriet.

291
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,183
She has dementia,

292
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,311
so she's totally cocoa puffs,
it's just a waste of time.

293
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,982
- So...
- Cocoa puffs.

294
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,235
Good to know.

295
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,072
<i>Welcome back, everyone.
I'm your host, Dr. Greta Mantleray.</i>

296
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,157
<i>What's giving you pain today?</i>

297
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,618
<i>I have Hank from Cold Harbor.</i>

298
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,078
<i>Yeah, hi, Dr. Greta.</i>

299
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,872
<i>Um, so, I love my wife,</i>

300
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,075
<i>we're raising two amazing little girls,
but I'm afraid of her, she's really...</i>

301
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,797
Thanks for pickin' me up.

302
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,299
Yeah, no problem.

303
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,049
Do you have my bag?

304
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,718
Of course.

305
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,513
Oh, it's heavy.

306
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,391
Oh, you're not kiddin'.

307
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,102
And I got you these...

308
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,062
for your allergies.

309
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,563
Oh.

310
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,359
You said there was
a chinchilla there.

311
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,487
Did you know female chinchillas
only have one mate,

312
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,656
but the males can have
as many as they want?

313
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,159
- Oh, really?
- I think that's interesting.

314
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,452
In your dreams, Bruce.

315
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,587
A

316
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,797
I read somewhere
that antihistamines are bad for you.

317
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
They stop your body from defending itself.

318
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,219
Then don't take 'em.

319
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,203
What the fudge?

320
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,730
Oh, it's Danielle's squirt gun,
I spray-painted it.

321
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,272
What?

322
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,400
You never know, Bruce.

323
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,613
What is that for?

324
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,281
Key to the city.

325
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,620
No alarm.

326
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,413
I told you these guys are dummies.

327
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,249
I don't even know who you are anymore.

328
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,251
What? Okay.

329
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,468
Okay, go ahead. Go.

330
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,803
- What are we doing?
- Go.

331
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,357
- I thought you knew the code.
- Wait. Shh.

332
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,513
- What are the dancin' numbers?
- Huh?

333
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,349
What are the numbers you say
when you're about to dance?

334
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,145
- Five, six, seven, eight?
- Oh.

335
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,733
Yes!

336
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,485
- They're fudgin' dancers too?
- Yeah.

337
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,864
Fuck.

338
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,871
Sh.

339
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm gonna sneeze.

340
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,758
Hey, don't sneeze.

341
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,260
Don't sneeze.
Think it down. Think it down.

342
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,137
You can do it, babe. Don't sneeze.

343
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,974
<i>Exactly the information I wanted.</i>

344
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>Every morsel of it.</i>

345
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,978
Hey. Alrighty.

346
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,148
You should have taken that antihistamine.

347
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,485
Oh, fudge.

348
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,030
Oh, not my face!

349
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,576
Wake up, you freakin' douchebag.

350
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,663
You wake up.

351
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,628
That's annoying.

352
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,797
You two made a big mistake tonight.

353
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,091
Don't you fuckin' dare.

354
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,174
You.

355
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,220
You're the nurse, aren't you?

356
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,931
I'm the legal guardian of that lemur.

357
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,767
That lemur became my lemur

358
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,769
when I stole it from you.

359
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,479
That is so far

360
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,606
- from how property law works.
- Yeah.

361
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,329
I still haven't decided
what I'm gonna do with you two.

362
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,735
Maybe, uh...

363
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,739
you accidentally get shot
breaking into my store.

364
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,617
Maybe you both just disappear in a ditch.

365
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,954
Yeah, maybe we take their skin
and put it on each other's bodies.

366
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,915
- What?
- We're... we're spitballin'.

367
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,250
No, we weren't.

368
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
Anyway, the point is, we have options.

369
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,756
But I know one thing.

370
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,298
Tonight...

371
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,554
you're gonna watch me skin that lemur.

372
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,117
- <i>Sebastian and sons...</i>
- Check it out.

373
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,018
<i>We have you surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.</i>

374
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,733
<i>Come out now
and we'll end this peacefully.</i>

375
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,735
- You okay?
- It's the cops.

376
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,779
Motherfuckers. Shit!

377
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,907
- It's good. It's good.
- Boys...

378
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,368
Your grandfather always used to say

379
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,329
the American dream is like a giant tree.

380
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,583
You just keep climbin' and climbin',

381
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,502
until you can almost touch
the fuckin' sun.

382
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,588
And if someone tries to chop it down...

383
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,716
you fuck 'em in the face.

384
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,385
Go fuck 'em, Dad.

385
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,934
<i>This is Fish and Wildlife.</i>

386
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

387
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,813
Fish...

388
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,150
and Wildlife?

389
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,236
I thought you were real fucking cops.

390
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,115
<i>There's not much of a difference,</i>

391
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>authority-wise.</i>

392
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,287
<i>Now come out with your hands up,</i>

393
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,709
<i>and with the hostage,
Wendy the lemur, unharmed.</i>

394
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,705
Fuck you!

395
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,934
Is that all you got?

396
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,519
I'm a bear!

397
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,233
I'm a motherfucking grizzly bear!

398
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,779
I eat fish and wildlife!

399
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,447
What the fuck?

400
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,284
It's finally happening!

401
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,203
- Brucie?
- Shit.

402
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,913
- It's okay.
- I get the Desert Eagle.

403
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,474
- I get the...
- I get the Desert Eagle.

404
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,458
- All right, on three. One, two...
- Three.

405
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,668
Give me the fucking Beretta.

406
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,311
- Lance! JC!
- What do we do about them?

407
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,314
- We'll deal with you later.
- Get the fuck up here!

408
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,338
Go help Dad! Go!

409
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,181
- We're comin', Dad!
- Go! Where are you guys?

410
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,263
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

411
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,555
- Untie me.
- Okay.

412
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,142
Wait for him to reload!

413
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,604
Wait... Now!

414
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,688
Heavy fire!

415
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,608
My furs are my babies!

416
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,276
Dad!

417
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,071
Fuck! Where are you guys?

418
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,115
Cover me out there.

419
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,160
- Come on.
- Pull, pull, pull, pull!

420
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,746
I can't get you untied.
I got to leave you here.

421
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,830
Don't you dare!

422
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,457
Let's go.

423
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,541
Let's go!

424
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,170
- Stay steady!
- Oh!

425
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,881
Okay, okay. It's okay, Wendy. It's okay.

426
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,508
- You ready?
- Ah, yeah.

427
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,591
- You ready?
- Yeah.

428
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,553
- Go!
- Stay with it.

429
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,308
- Lance, cover me over there.
- I'm trying.

430
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,309
Lance!

431
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,561
- Make it crisp!
- You make it crisp!

432
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,439
Hit 'em on that side!

433
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,400
Okay, now, here we go!

434
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,617
No, Lance!

435
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,661
No! No!

436
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,163
Back, back, back, back, back!

437
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,789
Crisp!

438
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,916
No!

439
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,229
- Gotta find the back door.
- Hey! Hey!

440
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,295
- What?
- Exit.

441
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,839
- Exit. Let's go. Come on!
- Oh, my boy!

442
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,758
My beautiful boy!

443
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,385
Come on. Babe.

444
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,430
- Come on, babe.
- Okay, okay!

445
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,224
Okay, okay!

446
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,935
It doesn't fit inside!

447
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,021
You killed a star!

448
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,066
A big, bright, burning star!

449
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,692
- Go! Go!
- Okay.

450
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,112
A full burning star!
Don't stop burning!

451
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,640
Put it in drive! Put it in drive!

452
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,411
Gonna put it in sport mode!

453
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,015
Go, Brucie! Go, go, go!
Take the parkway! Turn it left!

454
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,168
No seatbelt, baby!

455
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,761
You see it?

456
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,847
Uh, seventy...

457
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,225
- There.
- Oh, yeah.

458
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,981
Want me to go in with you?

459
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,193
No, Nan said it should just be me.

460
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,154
Okay.

461
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,866
I know this is all... very weird.

462
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,535
I don't find any of this weird.

463
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,202
You don't?

464
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,288
I don't know.

465
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,086
You always have a way of makin' life...

466
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,921
excitin'.

467
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,466
Okay.

468
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,263
Pardon me while I go deliver a lemur.

469
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,276
THE NAZLUNDS

470
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,240
Hello.

471
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,366
You Paula?

472
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,537
Is that Wendy?

473
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,496
Yeah.

474
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,250
- You realize what time it is?
- I...

475
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,334
I'm sorry.

476
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,086
Come in.

477
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,342
Thank you. Okay.

478
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,024
I like your Hummels.

479
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,942
Do you take your coffee black?

480
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,237
I should tell you why I'm here.

481
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,991
Honey, you don't know
why you're here.

482
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,660
Y-yes, I do.

483
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,205
Your mother explained it to me.

484
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,627
She said that you and her
had had your problems,

485
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,963
but as a gesture of reconciliation,

486
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,424
she wanted to give you this lemur.

487
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,134
Her lemur.

488
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,638
Why?

489
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,143
You know, I think it...

490
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,730
It's her way of telling you she loved you.

491
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,189
No.

492
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,484
That's not an "I love you" lemur.

493
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,611
That's a "go fuck yourself" lemur.

494
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,945
Um...

495
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,324
- Sorry?
- Got this in the mail yesterday.

496
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,618
"Dear Paula,

497
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,204
I'm close to dyin' now,

498
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,040
and I've been thinkin'
of that terrible argument we had.

499
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,583
Tempers flared,

500
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,669
you said things I'm sure you regret,

501
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,338
but now that death
may separate us forever,

502
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,966
maybe you'll finally
come to your senses and realize

503
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,968
lemurs are better than human children.

504
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,345
Here are the reasons why.

505
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,098
One, lemurs don't talk back.

506
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,100
Two, lemurs aren't selfish.

507
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,186
Three, lemurs don't destroy
what you hope to make of yourself."

508
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,070
OLIVIA MEADOWS,
YOUR "EMOTIONAL POLTERGEIST,"

509
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
WHO YOU SCREAMED AT DURING YOUR BLIP.

510
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,578
What the fudge?

511
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,830
- "Lemurs like to cuddle."
- What was that?

512
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,958
"And five, lemurs are not capable
of operating large vehicles

513
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,668
or heavy machinery.

514
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,632
A lemur will bring you far more joy
than a child ever will.

515
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,301
Please take Wendy

516
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,345
and avoid makin' the same mistake
I made by havin' you.

517
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,609
Love, your mother Nan." Maybe she's right.

518
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,021
I'm sorry?

519
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,651
Maybe you shouldn't have children.

520
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,284
I don't know who you are,

521
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,413
but you seem like exactly
the kind of person my mother would send.

522
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,707
How wonderful that she found you.

523
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,251
But you're too late.

524
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,128
I'm already pregnant.

525
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,048
In 22 weeks I'll be havin' a baby boy.

526
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,355
Congratulations. I'm gonna name him Greg.

527
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,971
Greg "Fuck U Nan" Nazlund.

528
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,654
I think it's a fittin' tribute to a woman

529
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,185
who wanted a fuckin' lemur
more than she wanted me.

530
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,700
What happened?

531
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,162
- She didn't want Wendy.
- No!

532
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,623
That's not gonna fly.
I'm goin' in there, I'll talk to her.

533
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,210
- No, Bruce, don't.
- No, that is not gonna fly.

534
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,089
Not after everything you did to get here.
I'm going in there, I'm gonna give her

535
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,632
- a piece of my mind.
- Don't!

536
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,218
Sorry. I'm sorry.

537
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,745
This one mornin'...

538
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,165
It was back when we lived upstate.

539
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,461
My sister and I woke up, and...

540
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,755
no one was home.

541
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,591
Not my mom...

542
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,427
not my dad...

543
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,471
The whole house was empty.

544
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,392
And my sister got scared.

545
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,856
And so I took her hand and...

546
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,358
I said no problem.

547
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,654
We'd go out and find 'em.

548
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,282
Like an adventure.

549
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,244
And so...

550
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,290
we went out and we started...

551
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,542
walkin' down this driveway.

552
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:16,171
You know, we had that long driveway
that went on for almost a mile?

553
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,422
Mm.

554
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,634
And after a while, I saw my dad's...

555
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,971
old gray pickup truck.

556
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,391
And I could see it was on
because of the exhaust.

557
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,647
And as we got closer...

558
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,321
I could see it was just one person
in the car, in the driver's seat.

559
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,824
I could see it was just my dad.

560
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,360
In the front... sittin' there.

561
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,294
I saw that he was cryin'.

562
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,508
He was crying, and he...

563
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,011
saw me in the rear-view.

564
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,600
When I looked at his eyes...

565
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,354
I knew right away...

566
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,357
that my mom was either dead...

567
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,151
or gone forever.

568
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,611
Somethin'.

569
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,784
And I had my sister's hand...

570
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,704
'cause all I cared about...

571
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,541
was keepin' her away.

572
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,735
And she stopped. And I just said...

573
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,758
"Come on.

574
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,511
Let's go back and let's...

575
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,555
make a cake.

576
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,475
We'll pretend it's your birthday."

577
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,976
And she...

578
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:59,190
She looked up at me,
and she said, "Okay."

579
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,696
And we walked back and we made a cake.

580
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,368
When did they get back together?

581
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,786
Hm?

582
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,625
Linda...

583
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,880
your parents aren't divorced.

584
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,388
Maybe I'm just tired.

585
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,020
We both got knocked on the head.

586
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,773
Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about.

587
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,968
I'll get her.

588
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,193
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Marino.

589
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

590
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,202
The kids were great.
Um, how was your date?

591
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,621
It was a blast.

592
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,141
You should get home.
Your mother's probably worried about you.

593
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,041
Yeah.

594
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,124
Is 60 cool?

595
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,710
Yeah, sure.

596
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,090
Thanks.

597
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,976
I wanna keep her.

598
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,311
Wendy.

599
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,899
I'm sorry.

600
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,818
Hm?

601
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,656
That I can't make you happy.

602
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,079
Of course you make me happy.

603
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,042
You've always made me happy.

604
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,672
Okay.

605
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,300
Where you goin'?

606
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,512
Take out the trash.

607
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,116
Get on your knees! Now!

608
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,784
She had nothin' to do with it.

609
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,454
- Get on your knees!
- I did it. I'm guilty.

610
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,955
Cuff him!

611
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,542
Hands behind your back. Come on.

1
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,872
Turn that off, would you, Bobby?

2
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,586
Do you smell that clean air?

3
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,838
I just smell manure.

4
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,715
Oh, it's different up here.

5
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,676
Good things happen
when you get out of the city.

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,471
I get shot every time I leave New York.

7
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,223
That's an exaggeration.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,517
Degas run in Cap-Ferrat? Shot.

9
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,687
Gauguin ceramics in Marquesas? Shot.

10
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,107
That time in Jackson Hole
with the wife? Also shot.

11
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,861
- But Jackson Hole was our biggest score.
- Still counts.

12
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,156
Hmm. I never noticed that pattern before.

13
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,253
Bobby, pull over.
I think my mind is playing tricks.

14
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,435
I know you ain't superstitious
like me, boss,

15
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,562
but I find this very serendipitous.

16
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,898
Maybe fate's tellin' you
you need a partner.

17
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,733
This job is gonna be a real doozy.

18
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,321
Get her as far away from here as possible.

19
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,865
I don't care if you have
to drive her to Atlantis.

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,451
Keep her away from that séance.

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,578
I'd need a boat
to take her to Atlantis, boss.

22
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,086
Hi, Ollie.

23
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,216
- What are you doing here?
- I was about to ask you the same thing.

24
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,801
Oh, you know me,

25
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,345
always poppin' up in the wrong place.

26
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,764
You know you need a ticket, right?

27
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,308
The Neverdies don't just let anyone in.

28
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,606
Wanna go together?

29
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,942
Sounds good.

30
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,950
It's good to see you, Ollie.

31
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,287
And it's disturbing to see you.

32
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,123
Hey! Hey!

33
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,584
Damn it, Ollie.

34
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,338
Presto chango.

35
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,853
Look.

36
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,814
It's happening again.

37
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:14,527
A fraction from one and nine
creating persistent inadvertent harmonies.

38
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,072
Inverse self-reflections are present.

39
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,827
Present in both.

40
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,494
That's fascinating.

41
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,332
Every time I separate them,
they just find their way back together.

42
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,583
They're sticking.

43
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,795
- It's reminiscent of iteration 41.
- It has to be hardware.

44
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,881
We should examine the IO spindle.

45
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,935
Yeah, there...

46
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,353
and there.

47
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,065
Just a little scoring.

48
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,193
Maybe something inside the F housing.

49
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,404
But it's impossible to tell
while we're still running.

50
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,240
Do you want to order a full reset?

51
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,953
No, my mother was too conservative
when it came to these anomalies.

52
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,832
Well, then, we'll push through.
I'll try to manage it manually.

53
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,710
Data tank
between one and nine, yes.

54
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,255
Uncomfortable, but manageable.

55
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,218
I'll pulsadrate nine out early
to unravel any globular weaving.

56
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,470
Just do your best to uncouple them.

57
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,516
I'll do the repairs
right before we run the evens.

58
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,766
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,936
Azumi...

60
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,400
We've shared intimacies.

61
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,278
You don't have to call me sir.

62
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,345
Ticket, please.

63
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,645
Lady Neverdine welcomes you
to the Full Moon Séance, Sir Hightower.

64
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,113
May I take your coat, sir?

65
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,470
I have never been...

66
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,723
After the séance,
well, I know things have changed.

67
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,035
- Will Arlie Kane be here?
- Is that Ollie Hightower?

68
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,686
- He is lonesome.
- Is he as big a Cervantes fan as we are?

69
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,272
...don't see it, I'm sorry....
- Oh, stop being so obvious.

70
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,459
- Lady Neberdine lets us tour the house.
- Not tonight.

71
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,443
- Oh, bother.
- Hey, go back to Hightower...

72
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,280
Do you know what they thought
owls meant in the old days, Ollie?

73
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,448
Hello, Olivia.

74
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,076
They're the moon incarnate.

75
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,245
They lead us someplace safe.

76
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,871
Every time.

77
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,751
This séance brought out
all the usual suspects, didn't it?

78
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,753
I only see one.

79
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,465
And I'm hoping
he'll take me under his wing.

80
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,467
Show me the ropes.

81
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,095
Not tonight, kid. I work alone.

82
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,599
You always gonna fly solo, Ollie?

83
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,367
<i>He said, "There's no such thing
as magic, of course."</i>

84
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,077
So I made him a bet.

85
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,789
I bet that I would do a trick
and he couldn't figure it out.

86
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,458
And if I lost,
I would give up magic forever.

87
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,169
- And if you won?
- He would give me his peerage.

88
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,422
You see, I wanted his "sir".

89
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,256
And I got it.

90
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,760
- How?
- Tell us!

91
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,387
I performed a trick.

92
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931
Oh, come on.

93
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,143
And he was unable to crack it,

94
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,520
and now I am Sir Ollie.

95
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,690
- You can imagine...
- You can't give away a title like that.

96
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,445
- Well, sure you can.
- But what was the trick, Ollie?

97
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,280
- Come on, show it to us.
- Yes.

98
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,657
I'll demonstrate on our fair butler here.

99
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,743
Good sir,
may I have a moment of your time?

100
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,455
I need to prepare
for the great illumination.

101
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,999
Oh, come here. It's just one minute.

102
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,584
Just right here, come on.

103
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,670
All right, you name a card

104
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,590
and it will appear
on the very top of this deck.

105
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,842
- Any card?
- Any card.

106
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,220
Nine of hearts.

107
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,556
Nine of hearts.

108
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,391
Presto chango!

109
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,811
Wow.

110
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,396
Fantastic.

111
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,690
- Amazing.
- If you'll excuse me.

112
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,234
You've done just fine,
and if you'll excuse me one moment.

113
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,154
You know that peach is bad news, Ollie.

114
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,198
Oh, no. She's just my wife.

115
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,874
What does that mean?

116
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,671
Sudden change and destruction
will lead to your liberation.

117
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,218
For his own sake, Bobby better be
lying dead in a ditch somewhere.

118
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,301
He's not.

119
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,474
How'd you trick him
into bringing you back, huh?

120
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,554
I didn't.

121
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,974
It's just very hard to say no to me.

122
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,310
Why don't we just lay our cards...

123
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,019
on the table?

124
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,232
What's that?

125
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,150
You have to pay up for a bad joke.

126
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,665
You are here to steal
the lost 53rd chapter of <i>Don Quixote.</i>

127
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,544
Just like me and half these lunatics
at this séance.

128
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,922
I don't know what you're talking about.

129
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:12,718
Attention, fellow Neverdies,
and those who are with us.

130
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,971
<i>Do you feel something in the room?</i>

131
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,598
<i>Do feel something vibrating among us?</i>

132
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,393
Fuck.

133
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,366
Component C protocol
hasn't been triggered.

134
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,950
Right now.

135
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,619
It hasn't.

136
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,038
Why the fuck is Gertie
actively participating?

137
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,291
What's the problem?

138
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,671
She's put herself in.

139
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,507
Who?

140
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,342
<i>Tonight is a special night.</i>

141
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,094
May I present...

142
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
the first Neverdie.

143
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,515
Gertie Neberdine.

144
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,685
A true goddess of Luna.

145
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,568
Oh!

146
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,407
- I can't believe it!
- All hail the Queen.

147
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,493
- Oh! I cn't believe it.
- Come on, I'll introduce you.

148
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,622
<i>There are some things
I haven't told you.</i>

149
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,875
Things I... I wasn't fully aware of
before I brought you back.

150
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,128
I think...

151
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,882
we have a serious problem.

152
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,967
I think our computer is...

153
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,721
horribly depressed.

154
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,395
And might be behaving unpredictably.

155
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,407
We're both great admirers.
Yes, I sensed it.

156
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,990
Arlie Kane, I know all about you.

157
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,286
I heard you two were separated.

158
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,247
We were. No longer.

159
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,168
Hon, let me get you a drink. Excuse me.

160
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,048
Oh!

161
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,509
This is Robert.

162
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,179
Hello.

163
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,849
What's wrong with him?

164
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,438
It's so hard to keep those
we've lost in our lives.

165
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,024
Don't you agree?

166
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,050
You must excuse me. All right. Okay.

167
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,438
Gotcha!

168
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,768
- Any lost chapters?
- You and your zapping around.

169
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,455
Why do you keep trying to ditch me, Ollie?

170
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,248
Because you are on my continent.

171
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,376
No more jokes, Arlie.
Go back to Paris. I'm working.

172
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,005
- You still drink gimlets?
- You still poison 'em?

173
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,799
I only poisoned the one.

174
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,301
What should we cheers to?

175
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,804
How about the night
my wife stole everything I have,

176
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,347
slipped me a Mickey, disappeared,

177
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,658
and I woke up with the cops
and three years in the clink.

178
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,101
I heard you pled guilty
to that Sister Wendy job.

179
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,229
Yeah, I have to quit doing that.

180
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,564
So what happened
to this dame that betrayed you?

181
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,150
Rumor has it
she ran off with another woman.

182
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,903
Sounds like she might have had
some sort of condition.

183
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,237
She did.

184
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,908
She always disappeared
just when you needed her the most.

185
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,535
To mistakes, then.

186
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
You hear what I heard?

187
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,254
- About what the lost chapter can do?
- No, and I don't care.

188
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,091
1615, Cervantes writes the final chapter
to his masterpiece.

189
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,467
So powerful...

190
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,346
that anyone who reads it
is lost in their own fantasies...

191
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,596
forever.

192
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,308
He shows it to a friend,
who slips into a coma.

193
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,686
Same with a neighbor, never comes out.

194
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,939
They live in their own dream worlds
until they die.

195
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,110
- Sounds swell.
- Cervantes thought the opposite.

196
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,154
He said being lost like that
was a fate worse than death.

197
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,575
For someone who didn't come here
for the lost chapter,

198
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,952
you seem to have thought a lot
about the lost chapter.

199
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,079
Don't be dense, Ollie.

200
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,748
I'm not here for some score.

201
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,375
But wouldn't you know?

202
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,795
The lost chapter is hidden
somewhere in this mansion.

203
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,924
I'm here to help you.

204
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,511
Goodbye, Arlie.

205
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,581
You don't know where it is, do you?

206
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
'Cause I do. It's through a mirror.

207
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,523
Who gave you that information?

208
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,443
Some wise old crone
in an alleyway in Barcelona.

209
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,695
What does it matter to you?

210
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,448
Because you lie constantly, that's why.

211
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,993
So what was your plan, then, Ollie?

212
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,622
To snoop from room to room
until you happened upon it next September?

213
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,082
Hah. Even if you knew where it was,

214
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,084
she'd have it in a safe,

215
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,212
and you can't crack a safe without me.

216
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,672
Well, I'm here to help you.

217
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,009
So for old times' sake, Mr. Magic Fingers,

218
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,303
how about I do intel
and you crack the safe?

219
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,100
We can't help but do
what we've always done.

220
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,479
Do I have a choice in the matter?

221
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,772
No.

222
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,319
9:05, time for the main event.

223
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,490
Do not make me regret trusting you.

224
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,116
I'll never betray you again.

225
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,410
Then wait for my signal.

226
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,998
Oh, joyous Celestial Goddess,

227
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:02,962
now is the time
for your energy to flow through us

228
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,841
and pour life back
into our lady's beloved.

229
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,510
Tonight we speak to Juno,

230
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,720
tonight we speak to Diana

231
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,182
and tonight her life brings life to us.

232
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,309
Lunar goddess?

233
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,896
Who will be tonight's astral nodes?

234
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,607
Oh.

235
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,404
Them, I think.

236
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,279
Those two.

237
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,781
Us?

238
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,210
- What the hell are we supposed to do?
- The moon will tell you.

239
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,671
We have reached...

240
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,008
maximum illumination.

241
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,924
They're playing our song.

242
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,295
Stop trying to stick yourselves together!

243
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,676
Oh, she's gone to the astral plane.

244
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, it's working! It's working!

245
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,057
Who wants to join her?
Another dancer. You. Now.

246
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,774
Wait, wait.

247
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,037
<i>...with a title that you trade away!</i>

248
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,584
<i>Because I'm their father,
and you're their mother! God damn it!</i>

249
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,796
<i>I have no idea where you are!</i>

250
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,798
- Is Mom coming back?
- ...that again.

251
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,216
<i>Is that about the size of it?</i>

252
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,636
- Um... tell me the whole story again.
<i>- You don't get to give that up, Rosie.</i>

253
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,429
<i>- No!</i>
- Once upon a time...

254
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,516
- there were two girls.
<i>- It's not a fucking title...</i>

255
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,684
They rode through the forest on a wolf.

256
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,269
A wolf, yeah.

257
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,730
They were going
to their grandmother's house.

258
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,315
But they didn't read the sign.

259
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,860
So, they got lost
and couldn't really find their way home,

260
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,572
- until they read one of the signs.
<i>- ...our daughter, who has your hair...</i>

261
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,407
It said, "Don't go this way."

262
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,338
- Good evening, fellas.
- Evening.

263
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,332
You didn't wait for my signal.

264
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,709
Good gravy!

265
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,086
Help me down.

266
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,052
Come on.

267
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,723
Look down here.

268
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,817
The mirror's right there.

269
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,486
Try this.

270
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,947
Locked.

271
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,367
Nothing here.

272
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,209
You're not supposed to be here.

273
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,003
There's another way, come on.

274
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,821
Owen.

275
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,905
Owen.

276
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,450
I mean, Sir... Sir Ollie.

277
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,204
So, I talked to a ritual cognitive.

278
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,415
Turns out Jed and I
were twins in the womb.

279
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,252
Except he strangled me
with the umbilical cord.

280
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,054
Don't worry about that.
That was... ectoplasm.

281
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,223
Go back to your quest.

282
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,351
Ah, Gertie's nuts. I'm gonna
stick around here a little bit.

283
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,562
Matches.

284
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,125
What is this?

285
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,837
The old crone said the spirit would
take me exactly where I wanted to be.

286
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,726
I don't know where to go from here.

287
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,440
Do you know what they thought
owls meant in the old days?

288
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,859
Come here.

289
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,708
Finally.

290
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,545
Something that makes sense.

291
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,048
How long is this gonna take?

292
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,342
This place gives me the willies.

293
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,886
Hey, Arlie.

294
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,306
Seeing we're both
inside a mirror and all...

295
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,683
Do you ever think your condition...

296
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,062
is a lot simpler than you think?

297
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,899
Maybe you're the one
with the broken heart, not me,

298
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,027
pretending I'm the one who's devastated.

299
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,238
It's the way
that you make yourself feel stronger.

300
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,282
Make me feel smaller.

301
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,327
Sure.

302
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,708
And maybe you like being the martyr
a little too much.

303
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,922
And you thought that "sir" would fix you,
but it hasn't fixed anything at all.

304
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,301
I guess we'll never know.

305
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,060
Why is it so tiny?

306
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,854
People were a lot smaller back then.

307
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,532
All right.

308
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,326
We should skeddadle.

309
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,578
Sorry, Ollie.

310
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,666
I'm gonna need you
to hand that tiny chapter to me.

311
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,128
I just really, really need it.

312
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,088
Sure.

313
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,182
You didn't have to use the gun.

314
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,394
I would have just given it to you.

315
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,647
That's always been your problem.

316
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,484
That's not my problem.

317
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,741
My problem is I let you get too close.

318
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,244
And you're poison.

319
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,657
There she is.

320
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,957
Subject nine, your experience
with the B pill is complete.

321
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Where's Ollie?

322
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,837
What you're about
to experience is the proximity test.

323
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,799
It's a cross-check of the data
that we've gleaned.

324
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,553
Helps the G.R.T.A. render
your reflections for the final pill.

325
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,970
I'm a friend.

326
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
And...

327
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,474
this is normal.

328
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:05,772
By the way, I was sorry to hear
about your sister being crushed,

329
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,941
and then burned to death...

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,901
in that car accident.

331
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,737
So...

332
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,825
Your score goes up or down
depending on the consistency

333
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,869
between your answers and, uh...

334
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,997
what we've observed.

335
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,583
The scale is from zero to ten.

336
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,793
Uh, anything below a 9.2

337
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,963
results in the termination
of your experience at the trial

338
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,423
due to, uh...

339
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,300
a lack of progress.

340
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,760
A lack of progress with what?

341
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,930
The dissolution
of your defense mechanisms.

342
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,601
Okay.

343
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,062
Consider this just me
verifying that your data is usable.

344
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,316
All you have to do is give
an honest account of your experience.

345
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,611
So, let's start by saying your name
for a baseline.

346
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,655
Annie Landsberg.

347
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,782
And, uh...

348
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,952
are you survived by any other relatives?

349
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,080
Just my dad, Hank Landsberg.

350
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,042
Your mother's deceased?

351
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,126
I don't know.

352
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,253
Huh.

353
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,507
Do you know where you are right now?

354
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,134
I'm in a pharma trial.

355
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:21,014
Considering you've been
abusing the A pill for some time,

356
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,060
I'd like you to tell me
about your experiences with the B pill.

357
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:31,399
I had what felt like a hundred dreams
all on top of each other.

358
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,901
I call them reflections.

359
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,945
Neurochemically, they're very similar,
but so is psychosis.

360
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,782
How many experiences
do you think you had?

361
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,869
I remember two well.

362
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,247
But there were more.

363
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,834
And more underneath those.

364
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,588
It's a globular cluster
of arborized realities.

365
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,175
Well, they were realities
that mattered more than mine.

366
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,094
Describe your reality.

367
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,055
Uh, my reality...

368
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,665
is that I am depressed. And I
have been for a very long time.

369
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,402
Let's try and focus
on your reflections.

370
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,658
In one, I was Linda from Long Island.

371
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,786
I could smell her perm.

372
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,706
She was a nurse and a...

373
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,251
mother, and a wife, which is...

374
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,003
the opposite of anything I've ever wanted.

375
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,551
And...

376
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,261
then...

377
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,642
I was Arlie.
She was a thief and a con artist.

378
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,686
A con artist is a liar.

379
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,689
Why are you a liar?

380
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,150
She...

381
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,489
I think people lie because they're afraid,

382
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,284
and she was afraid
and she didn't want anyone to see that.

383
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,369
Did anyone?

384
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,581
Owen. He did.

385
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,583
He saw me. He saw...

386
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,751
her.

387
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,170
Them.

388
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,463
Subject one?

389
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,298
Describe his presence.

390
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,969
We were connected in all of them.

391
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,306
With Linda...

392
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,268
it was the kind of connection

393
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,520
where you meet in seventh grade,
and then...

394
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,400
you look up and 20 years later,
he's still there...

395
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,612
holding your hand while you have a baby.

396
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,492
You remembered whole lives together?

397
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,534
Yes.

398
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,330
Did the pill do that?

399
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,248
It wasn't designed to.

400
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,296
Why do you think you experience
so many of these, uh, lives...

401
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,713
with him?

402
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,383
He said there was a pattern.

403
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,762
And that we were connected
to each other somehow. I...

404
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,472
I mean, I thought he was crazy.

405
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,017
So, I told him there is no pattern.
There's just chaos.

406
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,228
Let me ask it...

407
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,230
in a different way.

408
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,150
Why do you think you found yourself
trying to deliver a lemur?

409
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,278
Mr. Milgrim's presence notwithstanding.

410
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,284
The woman in that dream was Paula Nazlund,

411
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,331
the mother of the person
that killed my sister.

412
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,501
My real sister, in this life.

413
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,215
And sometimes I fantasize about
if Greg Nazlund had never been born.

414
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,217
And when you were a thief...

415
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,178
how do you explain that reflection?

416
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,516
I had a goal.

417
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,687
I needed to get something.

418
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,025
And it... didn't seem to matter
who I hurt.

419
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,404
- Is that a behavior you share in life?
- No.

420
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,699
Is that a behavior you've seen exhibited
in a parental figure?

421
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,033
Is this therapy now?

422
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,034
I thought this was supposed to be
better than that.

423
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,329
It's not therapy.

424
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,130
Did you enter this trial
in lieu of harming yourself?

425
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,213
No!

426
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,843
Why did the number not change?

427
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,636
That's true.

428
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,221
Were you suicidal?

429
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,310
Arlie is like my mother.

430
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:42,233
She could charm anyone,
she would make deals with people.

431
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,862
She would say things to me like,
"This is just between you and me, Annie.

432
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,282
You're the only one who understands."
That's how she would get you.

433
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,451
And then she knew that you gave a shit,

434
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,953
and so your guard was down
and she would gut you.

435
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,038
Okay? How's that?

436
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,249
It disturbs you, this idea of...

437
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,753
behaving in the same way
that your mother behaves.

438
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,465
Yes.

439
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,888
Did you and your sister
make any of these special...

440
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,805
deals?

441
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,894
Similar to the ones
that you and your mother had made?

442
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,186
No.

443
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,190
Ours were different.

444
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,109
How?

445
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,696
Ours was a pact.

446
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,235
I took care of her when we were little.
And she took care of me when we grew up.

447
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,268
Here's your diagnostic.

448
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,449
Someone will be through shortly
to collect you.

449
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,166
What's your report?

450
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,003
Your security
leaves something to be desired.

451
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,088
Expect a bill first thing.

452
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,385
It doesn't work, you know.

453
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,004
The chapter. I already tried.

454
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,600
Every mistake I've ever made
started with "It's too good to be true."

455
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,609
So, what do you say, Ollie?

456
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,570
About a partnership?

457
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:56,242
I told you where the safe was.
That's gotta be worth somethin', right?

458
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,494
Took me a minute.

459
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,037
Thanks for that.

460
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,498
But I don't do partners.

461
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,460
What would you have wished for...

462
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,712
if that chapter had worked?

463
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,590
I keep my fantasies to myself.

464
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,927
Well, maybe I'll see you again
sometime soon.

465
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,603
Bobby, you've got some explaining to do.

466
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,874
You want me to turn it off?

467
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,127
No, no, you can leave it, Bobby.

468
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,713
I'm really sorry, boss.

469
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,130
She shot me.

470
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,802
She shot you, Bobby?

471
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,930
Only in the shoulder.

472
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,434
I've been trying to motivate myself
to get in there.

473
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,977
I haven't been able to move.

474
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,397
She really wanted to come to the party.

475
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,779
Did you and her reconnect, at least?

476
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,075
No, it didn't work out.

477
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,954
She had too much else on her mind.

478
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,037
Hm.

479
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,542
Aren't you gonna miss her, boss?

480
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,046
You know what, Bobby?

481
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,093
Life is simple as hell
until you bring on a partner.

482
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,402
Welcome back, subjects.

483
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,528
Welcome back.

1
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,322
Welcome back, subjects. Welcome back.

2
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>It felt like she was really there.</i>

3
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,311
Well, of course she wasn't really there.

4
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,689
That was just your brain
lying to your mind,

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,232
and your mind was listening.

6
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,862
Why do you think you have so many...

7
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,990
experiences with subject nine...

8
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,491
in particular?

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,535
I get...

10
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,248
fixated on people.

11
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,170
I start seeing them everywhere.

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,050
It only spiraled out of control one time,
but, uh, it happens a lot.

13
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,427
If you were to describe in a few sentences

14
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,806
what these experiences were trying
to show you, what would you say?

15
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,766
That for some reason it's more exciting

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,519
to tell people that I cut
than to actually cut.

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,854
Do you have any sense why that's true?

18
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,482
Probably something about my father...

19
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,276
or my mother.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,362
Say more about your mother.

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,366
Is your mother that really famous lady?

22
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,993
The one with the radio show
and all those books?

23
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,454
She's the one that fucked you up?

24
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,251
I think it's too easy, though,

25
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,129
when people blame everything
on the parents...

26
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,300
as though we're just revisions
and mixtures of them.

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,927
Isn't that what they say?

28
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,348
Once you begin to appreciate
the structure of the mind,

29
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,684
it's modularity on a molecular scale,

30
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,645
there's no reason to believe that
anything about us can't be changed.

31
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,895
The mind...

32
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,398
can be solved.

33
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,400
What?

34
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,903
Tell me more about the bowling league
in your reflections.

35
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:41,244
I was just murdering people with a hammer,
trying to find my dead father's balls.

36
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,415
There was no meaning in it.

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,335
Why don't I ask you
the most important question?

38
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,839
What do you think is wrong with you?

39
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,552
You know that movie,
<i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

40
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,052
Yes.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,182
If that happened to me...

42
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,936
there would be no difference in the world.

43
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,065
What's wrong isn't that I'm sick.

44
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,695
It's that I don't matter.

45
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,451
Great.

46
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,374
There's your diagnostic.

47
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,664
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

48
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,749
I don't want to talk.

49
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,710
- After all that?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

50
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,711
The lemur.

51
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,591
<i>Don Quixote.</i> I know you know
what I'm talking about.

52
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,717
No, I don't.

53
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,427
That's not supposed to happen.

54
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,054
I was asking around in here,

55
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,596
and...

56
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,558
- we're not supposed to be together.
- We weren't together.

57
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,269
There's nothing going on here.

58
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,771
It's a drug,
and you hallucinated all that.

59
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,700
We need to talk.

60
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,827
Go somewhere else.

61
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,209
Explain, Azumi.
The parts you didn't tell me before.

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,586
Yes, well, it's somewhat complicated.

63
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,910
Then help me understand, Azumi,

64
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,674
because I was clearly brought here
because something was going on.

65
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,052
You need my help to fix it,
so what am I here to fix?

66
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,309
After you were suspended, the problems
with the C phase started getting worse.

67
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,270
Iterations 48 and 49 were...

68
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,481
were... particularly bad.

69
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,691
And the McMurphys?

70
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,359
Four.

71
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,945
Four?

72
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,116
Why didn't somebody call?

73
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,953
- Jesus Christ, Azumi.
- You weren't stable.

74
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,664
I am stable.

75
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,500
Your inability to control yourself
had left...

76
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,627
I have a diagnosed disorder.

77
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,173
Had left us here trying to complete
your life's work while you were...

78
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,218
copulating with software!

79
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,637
What did you do, Azumi?

80
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,065
I coded the safety net and installed
it deep within Gertie's neural core.

81
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,691
It was a simple idea.

82
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,779
I thought it would help the AI protect
the subjects if they got in danger.

83
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,322
What was the concept?

84
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,115
Empathy.

85
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,327
Just a tiny little bit.

86
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,499
- You gave my computer feelings.
- Just a tiny little bit.

87
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,961
Just enough to let her anticipate
what the subjects might be feeling.

88
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,589
That way she could pull them out
if they ever got stuck.

89
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,635
James, it worked.
She started protecting them.

90
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,972
There have been zero McMurphys
since I installed the net.

91
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,724
Then why is she depressed?

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,396
I gave her simple, emotional programming
five months ago.

93
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,067
And two months ago,
I believe she and Robert...

94
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,155
began an inappropriate workplace affair.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,491
So she's in mourning?

96
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,038
This printed at my station...

97
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,040
15 minutes ago.

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,879
"Dear, Dr. Fujita.

99
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm unsure if I can continue my work
on this project.

100
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,223
I need to know myself,
really know myself"?

101
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,309
Ugh.

102
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,065
Ugh.

103
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,444
She needs a grief counselor.
She's in tremendous pain.

104
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,070
She's a computer.

105
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,575
- Ugh.
- I know it's been seven years, but you...

106
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,077
you have to call your mother.

107
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,161
No!

108
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,538
No! No, no, no.

109
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:40,084
No, but your mother would have a unique
understanding of the way Gertie is...

110
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,714
No! My mother is a venomous,
egotistical charlatan

111
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,302
who deploys catchphrases and platitudes
and therapies of the day

112
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,930
in order to dupe millions of people
out of their money and their happiness.

113
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,642
No. No, my mother sells happiness.

114
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,395
She sells it,
then it crumbles in your hand

115
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,565
the minute you're out of earshot
of her magical thinking

116
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,359
and her platitudes and her invented words,

117
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,195
and her primal yawps,

118
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,489
and her steps to success.

119
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,241
No. No, I'm not bringing her here.

120
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,745
My mother is not a healer.
My mother is sick.

121
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,538
She's sick, Azumi,

122
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,541
and if I brought her here, she would
destroy everything that I ever built

123
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,376
because that's what my mother does.

124
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,549
Was what happened at the gala
your mother's fault too?

125
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,096
The GRTA will be fine.

126
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,142
Prep the Evens for behavioral.

127
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,948
Odds.

128
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,825
Converse with your partner.

129
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,666
So...

130
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,145
I'd talk to you about the weather,
except I don't even know what time it is.

131
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,921
It's like being in a fucking casino.

132
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,676
Are you having a good time?

133
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,638
Not really.
I'm actually thinking about leaving.

134
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,348
I would if I could afford to.

135
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,809
The last one scared the shit out of me.

136
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,728
I don't trust these people.

137
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,313
Why don't you trust them?

138
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,233
I don't know.
It's like suddenly one doctor leaves,

139
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,402
the new one has my mom's haircut,

140
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,321
and I'm pretty sure
those aren't his real eyebrows.

141
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,615
Did you get one of those
diagnostic printouts?

142
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,158
But I need the money.

143
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,828
Don't take it too seriously.

144
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,911
I don't.

145
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,791
I've never had a therapist
that could figure me out.

146
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,837
Still, doesn't seem
to make much sense to me

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,560
to be telling people what's wrong with them...
before they can figure it out for themselves.

148
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,053
They're saying this is the last time
they trial run this thing.

149
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,806
You think they would have
gotten it right by now.

150
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,427
It seems like there are
a lot of problems around here.

151
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,892
Hell, yeah.

152
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,233
You married?

153
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,069
You got a girlfriend?

154
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,904
You got a boyfriend?

155
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,988
No.

156
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,158
I was married for a couple of years,

157
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,786
and my wife couldn't handle my tics.

158
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,832
I didn't need that paper to know
that there wasn't much hope.

159
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,710
Maybe this last pill
does something for me.

160
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,212
Make me normal again.

161
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,756
What are your tics?

162
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,300
When I get anxious, I, um...

163
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,511
end up eating stuff.

164
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,929
Like junk food?

165
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,723
Yeah.

166
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,806
Mmm.

167
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,559
And dryer sheets.

168
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,312
Pencil shavings.

169
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,773
Hair from our brushes.

170
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,069
What's normal, anyway?

171
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,290
I know you and I have had
our differences...

172
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,795
but I would like
for you to try and cooperate.

173
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,048
I fixed you up.

174
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,758
Good as new.

175
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,194
The most important thing in my life
was supposed to get away from me,

176
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,363
and now I have the chance to get it back.

177
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,783
To guide us to the finish line.

178
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,580
Azumi told me about your...

179
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,207
heart.

180
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,337
I just need you to try
and power through...

181
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,172
until the end.

182
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,760
I'll take care of you
once the ULP is approved.

183
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,845
Please.

184
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,866
You don't know what you're asking for.

185
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,508
"But what if I told you
there was one hug,

186
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,803
one divine hug, one panacea hug

187
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,681
that could do more
than the simple everyday hug,

188
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,767
and that people who learn this hug

189
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,103
are obligated to use it
whenever they see pain in the world?

190
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,941
You'd likely say, 'Dr. Mantleray,
that's outrageous, ' and you'd be right.

191
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,236
But so would I. I almost always am."

192
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,197
Fuck!

193
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,327
As usual, Samantha...

194
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,872
screwed up every single em dash.

195
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,956
What is she?

196
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,584
A blithering idi...

197
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,296
Julio.

198
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,177
Julio!

199
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,234
Hello.

200
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,947
It's the only way to move forward.

201
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,241
Yoda's signed off on this.

202
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,243
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Talk to her, James.

203
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,119
- <i>Hello?!</i>
- Talk to her!

204
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,040
<i>Julio, turn off that god-awful music!</i>

205
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,332
Hello, Mother.

206
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,501
James. <i>Yes.</i>

207
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,796
<i>It's me.</i>

208
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,259
How are... you?

209
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,428
James, what a nice surprise.

210
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,472
It's good to hear your voice too.

211
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Um...

212
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,185
Listen, Mom.

213
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,269
<i>Um...</i>

214
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,982
<i>I'm calling because we had...
a death at the lab.</i>

215
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,526
<i>Dr. Robert Muramoto.</i>

216
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,944
Your rival?

217
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,489
Oh, I wouldn't call him my rival.

218
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,033
The one you always feared
was more intelligent than you?

219
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,037
We were colleagues.
We weren't competitive in the least.

220
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,624
I understand why you couldn't see
how badly you wanted to destroy him.

221
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,043
<i>He was a lovely, sensitive man.</i>

222
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,754
He always went out of his way
to ask me how I was.

223
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,883
Yes, he was very fond of you.

224
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,499
<i>I'm sorry he passed away.</i> - Mm-hmm.
<i>- That's very difficult.</i>

225
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,973
Sure, it is. Listen, Mom, I...

226
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,982
I know we've had
our problems in the past...

227
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,403
and I have never said
I'm sorry for my part in them.

228
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,868
Hello?

229
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
<i>Mom.</i>

230
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
<i>Are you there?</i>

231
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,415
Yes.

232
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,687
I'm waiting for you to say you're sorry.

233
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,296
- I just said it.
- <i>Oh, no, no.</i>

234
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,214
You said you never said you were sorry.

235
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,382
Help me.

236
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,009
Say you're sorry.

237
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,141
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,061
Okay?

239
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,943
What do you need, Jamie?

240
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,526
Well...

241
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,197
I need you to do what you do best.

242
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,075
<i>We're at a critical moment in the trial,</i>

243
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,745
<i>and one of our employees
is very upset about Robert.</i>

244
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,664
<i>She can't work.</i>

245
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,000
<i>But she's vital to the whole operation.</i>

246
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,044
<i>She needs to talk to somebody,</i>

247
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,629
<i>and she's asked for you.</i>

248
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,004
Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,180
She believes...

250
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,225
that you are
one of the greatest healers...

251
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,018
ever born.

252
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,102
Well...

253
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,732
My day is really quite... busy.

254
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,859
Well, that settles it then.
You can't come.

255
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,445
<i>But I could move a few things around.</i>

256
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,198
I'll be there in a few hours.

257
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,199
Okay.

258
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,119
That'll be very helpful.

259
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,620
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

260
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,664
<i>Muy bien?</i>

261
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,043
Gas up the Miata.

262
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,307
Stop avoiding me.

263
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,351
I'm not avoiding you.

264
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,395
It's post-dinner relaxation time.

265
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,571
You're mad at me because of how
I treated you in our marriages.

266
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,365
- What marriages?
- Stop it.

267
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,702
Don't make me feel crazy. That is not
a nice thing to do to a person.

268
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,370
You know I have a good brain.

269
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,831
- Oh, hey. What are you guys doing?
- Soo, go in your pod.

270
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,914
Okay.

271
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,751
You're not supposed to be in here.

272
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,047
Come on, will you just talk to me? Please.

273
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,181
Yeah, I remember.

274
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,974
You remember, I knew it.

275
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,603
Don't you think it's strange that
we were connected and nobody else was?

276
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,982
Maybe that's part of their experiment.

277
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,610
Connecting people,
messing with their heads.

278
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,487
I know. That's what I thought too.

279
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,031
But then I heard
about the globular cluster,

280
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,451
and I started thinking
that maybe this is something deeper.

281
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
And...

282
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,662
cosmic...

283
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,500
like some multi-reality brain magic shit.

284
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,543
Like what you were saying
when you came in here.

285
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,588
- Are you making fun of me?
- No.

286
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,508
Our brains
were inside each other's brains, Owen.

287
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,176
I'm trying to figure out what happened.

288
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,388
I think I'm gonna leave tonight.

289
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,472
Why?

290
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,102
This isn't fun for me.

291
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,729
It's dredging up a lot of old stuff.

292
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,317
I'm in the middle of this legal thing
with my family.

293
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,821
They want me to testify for my brother.

294
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,199
Lie for him to keep him out of trouble.

295
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,679
James.

296
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,981
Hello, Mother.

297
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,069
You've had work done?

298
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,987
No.

299
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,615
Looks nice.

300
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,124
Your prostitute friend
will not be allowed to come in.

301
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,085
<i>Espera en el carro.</i>

302
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,382
And you are?

303
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,513
Dr. Fujita.

304
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,515
How nice for you.

305
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,267
I like order.

306
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,438
I like to know what my day is gonna be.

307
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,190
I like my apartment,

308
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,192
my job.

309
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,276
Just a normal...

310
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,613
life. That's all I want.

311
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,866
But isn't that
sort of what therapy is about?

312
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,827
Dredging up old stuff.

313
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,746
I like it when it's calm.

314
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,335
In a quiet room,
not with fur lords shooting Uzis

315
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,670
or magical chapters of books.

316
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,049
Sorry, that <i>Don Quixote </i>part was me.

317
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,594
My sister read that when she was 12,
and my dad used to go on and on about it,

318
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:24,348
like it was proof
of how gifted and smart she was.

319
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,351
I guess that's why you felt the need
to shoot my driver over it.

320
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,687
What did you want to do with it?
I mean, if we were still in there...

321
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,649
what would you have used it for?
What fantasy would you have gone into?

322
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,318
It's stupid.

323
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,693
You can tell me.

324
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,572
I'm your new pharma-trial friend.

325
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,869
I had a plan.

326
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,082
We were gonna go somewhere together.

327
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,254
We were in a car.
We were driving really fast.

328
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,382
Someone was chasing us,
I don't know who.

329
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,592
It felt like an escape.

330
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,303
I was just laughing.

331
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,474
And I had this huge smile on my face.

332
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,353
It hurt it was so big.

333
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,774
We were just two people...

334
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,859
looking out for each other.

335
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,735
It's stupid.

336
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,989
That doesn't sound stupid to me.

337
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,465
Are you two trying
to get kicked out of here?

338
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,498
No.

339
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,167
Don't test me, Rapunzel.

340
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,004
Cohabitation is strictly prohibited.

341
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,462
Out.

342
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,932
Oh, it's her.

343
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,184
What is the lady from the seance
doing here?

344
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,353
Her name's Dr. Greta Mantleray.

345
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,063
Maybe it's weird Dr. Guy's Mom.

346
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,947
- Thank you, James.
- She is.

347
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,777
I asked him in the thing.
He's all fucked up about it.

348
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,369
Artificial intelligence has come so far.

349
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,453
Who knew?

350
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,708
After I personally discovered
Dr. Fujita at MIT...

351
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,919
she built
the initial neuro-core structure.

352
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,799
With her ability to render and manipulate
the sleep state of our subjects,

353
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,720
the GRTA has become
the most advanced computer system...

354
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,222
the world has ever known.

355
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,478
With the...

356
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,190
addition of this emotional element...

357
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,442
- The safety net.
- Yeah.

358
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,319
The safety net.

359
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,864
To be honest, we just don't know
what we're dealing with here.

360
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,451
The consciousnesses of two of our subjects
have been crossing. They've been...

361
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,705
- finding one another.
- Due to superficial mechanical problems.

362
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,248
Maybe they're soul mates.

363
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,460
- I'm sorry?
- Maybe their energies

364
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,838
are seeking out each other's,
despite the restrictions.

365
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,635
Maybe these two have a cosmic connection.

366
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,180
Please, Mother.

367
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,475
The GRTA is not some woo-woo dream catcher

368
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,978
that's reuniting cosmic dust
after the big bang.

369
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,980
It's far more sophisticated than that.

370
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,819
Are you two
having a romantic relationship?

371
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,196
- That would be inappropriate.
- We used to be.

372
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,407
I'm just curious. I...

373
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,075
I know with your paraphilia

374
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:34,037
you've always had a difficult time
forming long-term relationships.

375
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,664
I rejected that diagnosis.

376
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,709
And my disorder
is entirely under my own control.

377
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,754
It only flares up, of course,

378
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,998
when things of great importance
are taken away from me.

379
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,508
Like your father.

380
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,801
No, not my...

381
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,388
This, the ULP.

382
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,350
I remember the masturbation binges
after your father disappeared.

383
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,145
- Back to the matter at hand.
- A masturbation reference.

384
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,228
Stop it!

385
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,692
May I ask an obvious question?

386
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,110
Please.

387
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,866
I understand you're having a problem
with your computer and that your...

388
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,162
computer needs to talk to someone,

389
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,290
but why on Earth would you call on me
to be that someone?

390
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,255
Because the computer is...

391
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,299
you.

392
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:31,094
- What?
- My approach to the construction of the AI

393
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,346
required to complete your son's vision

394
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,266
came from my studies
with Dr. Leon Krovackian...

395
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,768
Dear, you don't need to try to impress us.

396
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,562
The...

397
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:48,653
metapsychology of the ABC system
draws largely from your...

398
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,949
earlier, more serious academic work
regarding confrontation, Dr. Mantleray.

399
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,285
More serious academic work?

400
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,372
Yes. I inputted heavily
from your PhD thesis, actually.

401
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,792
Before your commercial success

402
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,837
drew you to other forms of pop therapy,
your work was quite profound.

403
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,214
Pop therapy?

404
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,634
It's just a term that's sometimes used,
and I also scanned your brain.

405
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,778
Never mind
the technical details, Mother.

406
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,639
I've simply found an elegant way
to fix people.

407
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,268
Lobotomies were considered elegant
when Moniz invented them. Jamie...

408
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,855
how many of your subjects
have ended up catatonic?

409
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,689
Zero.

410
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,776
Roughly.

411
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,365
When did you get the idea
to make these drugs?

412
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,408
Seven years ago.

413
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,995
Let me just see if I understand this.

414
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,872
So...

415
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:47,963
seven years ago, and shortly after you and
your therapist mother stopped speaking,

416
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,884
you decided to develop a sequence of drugs
that would eliminate therapy altogether.

417
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,512
But now your mother computer is sad,

418
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,099
and so you had to call in your real mother
to talk to her about her feelings.

419
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,725
Is that all correct?

420
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,896
That's exactly the situation, yes.

421
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,568
Well...

422
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,579
Take me to the patient.

423
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,458
I need to speak to Dr. Fujita
outside for a moment.

424
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Fine.

425
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,755
She said yes too easily.
Something's wrong.

426
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,676
She was trying to lead me
to some kind of... insight.

427
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,428
James.

428
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,221
You are on the cusp of achieving

429
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,141
everything you've ever wanted to achieve
in your life.

430
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,435
You've been given a second chance.

431
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,021
We need her help. Let her help.

432
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,316
Oh, just the idea of her
even being inside this lab makes it...

433
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,735
disgusting to me.

434
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,027
James.

435
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,906
Do you know why I didn't leave with you
when you were thrown off the project?

436
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,285
Yes. Your self-interest
trumped your feelings for me.

437
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
No!

438
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,872
I wanted to leave with you,

439
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,167
but I knew the only way
to get this study completed properly

440
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,294
was if I stayed to manage Robert.

441
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,965
I truly believe if we get your vision
of the ULP to market,

442
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,092
the lives of billions could change.

443
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,887
The people of this world are suffering.

444
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,474
If we make it through this iteration,

445
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,559
you'll be a hero.

446
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,312
Let her help.

447
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,740
This is extremely potent.
The moment I light this,

448
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:47,123
I need you to put your lips
around the tip and suck.

449
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,808
Oh, freebasing. What year were you born?

450
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,422
1977.

451
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,925
Ah, yes. That was the night.

452
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,008
Huh. Suck.

453
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,039
Be careful in there, Mom.

454
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,875
Thank you for helping me.

455
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,212
I'm gonna help you, Jamie.

456
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,840
I know exactly what you need.

457
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,843
What?

458
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,139
What the fuck did she just say?

459
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,599
She said she was going to help you.

460
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,236
My father left
when I was a child.

461
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,196
Just...

462
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,076
went and started a new life
with someone else, or so I've heard.

463
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,871
You know what my mother did after he left?

464
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,954
What?

465
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,167
She laid in my bed for two months,

466
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,212
and talked to me about
how she wanted to hang herself.

467
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,048
I was eight.

468
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,305
Does that sound like
the world's greatest healer to you?

469
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,683
I'm sorry that happened.

470
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,184
I'm not.

471
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,853
Made me who I am.

472
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,731
Led me here... to this.

473
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,374
Where will you sleep?

474
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,169
Lab B is empty.

475
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,422
Probably find a gorilla mating pod
down the hall.

476
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,341
Good.

477
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,144
I prefer you nearby.

478
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,217
<i>Owen.</i>

479
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,665
<i>Hello, Owen.</i>

480
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,380
<i>Why do you have your suitcase?
Did you decide to leave?</i>

481
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,801
I need to go to an emergency room.

482
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,471
<i>Why?</i>

483
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,142
Because I don't know
if this is really happening.

484
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,936
<i>Why do you think that?</i>

485
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,733
Because celebrity therapist
Dr. Greta Mantleray is here.

486
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,404
Because I'm talking to a wall.

487
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,491
Because I can't tell what's real.

488
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,244
I need real medication.

489
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,874
I need to be hospitalized. I need help.

490
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,794
<i>What about all your friends, the Odds?</i>

491
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,173
<i>I'm going to kill them if you go.</i>

492
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,256
What?

493
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,927
<i>I'm going to cure them all
if you go, Owen,</i>

494
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,471
<i>and you'll be the only one
who wasn't helped.</i>

495
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,600
You can't cure me.
There's no cure for schizophrenia.

496
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,270
<i>But I thought you were misdiagnosed.</i>

497
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:24,817
<i>I thought it was only a blip
and that you were 100% compos mentis.</i>

498
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,236
You can't cure me.

499
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,240
<i>Your friend, Annie, has suffered like me.</i>

500
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:36,454
<i>I think I'm going to keep her
with the other subjects I've collected.</i>

501
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,039
What does that mean?

502
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,460
<i>The Queen will unlock the door for you.</i>

503
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,379
What does that mean about Annie?

504
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,923
Hello?

505
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,963
What kind of fucked up stuff
you think we'll experience with this one?

506
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,718
You know we don't have to do this, right?

507
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,222
We don't have to let some computer
go in our head. We can just go right now.

508
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,392
I know I said all that stuff
about therapy before, but...

509
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,062
I don't know, this place feels different.

510
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,649
I actually feel better today
than I did yesterday.

511
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,652
Someone died in front of you
two days ago.

512
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,237
Well, yeah, but...

513
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,583
When I was a kid,
I found this hawk in the park,

514
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,046
and I just had this feeling
that I had to protect it

515
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,048
because it was so strong.

516
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,426
But it was, like, hurt also,

517
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,845
and I brought it home
and I helped it get better.

518
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,599
And then it ate my brother's gerbil,
and he killed it with a hammer,

519
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,922
and I've always regretted that.

520
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,655
What the fuck are you talking about, Owen?

521
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,772
I'm worried about going back in there.

522
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,814
You two.

523
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,649
It's time.

524
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,736
Hey, don't be worried

525
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,364
because we'll probably be together again,
right? We can protect each other.

526
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,408
Come on.

527
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,142
Give me bio.

528
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,603
Clean across the board.
They're ready.

529
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,897
And you've checked
the diagnostic twice?

530
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,108
Gertie's behaving
exactly as she should be?

531
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,819
She looks perfect.
I don't see anything wrong at all.

532
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,827
Subjects, please ingest your pills.

533
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,746
And one additional message for you...

534
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,751
<i>The C phase of the testing utilizes
a more powerful waveform.</i>

535
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,505
<i>Do not be alarmed if you feel
a buzzing or warmth in your head</i>

536
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,298
<i>as the trial phase begins.</i>

537
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,760
They've got the microwaves on high.

538
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,641
When I was a kid, I used to put
all kinds of stuff in the microwave.

539
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,811
Soap bars, peeps.

540
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,231
You ever see what happens
to a peep in a microwave?

541
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,941
- What?
<i>- As we begin</i>

542
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,193
<i>- your final experience...</i>
- Boom.

543
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,238
<i>...please follow my voice
as I count backwards from ten.</i>

544
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,448
- Your head is not a peep.
<i>- Nine.</i>

545
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,533
Eight.

546
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,908
Seven. Six.

547
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,744
<i>Five.</i>

548
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,246
<i>Four.</i>

549
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,789
<i>Three.</i>

550
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,166
<i>Two. One.</i>

1
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,904
<i>So, how are you feeling, Owen?</i>

2
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,074
Good.

3
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,619
You know...

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,956
I never told you this before, Owen,
but, um...

5
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,375
you had another brother.

6
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,755
Long before you were born,
long before your mother, uh, disappeared.

7
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,924
He had a lot of feelings too.

8
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,678
Cried nonstop.
Couldn't take care of himself.

9
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,638
He was hiding things.

10
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,266
Wasn't loyal.

11
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,062
‐What the fuck happened to him?
‐I put him up for adoption.

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,981
He was only four months old,
so fortunately I, uh...

13
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,232
I caught it early.

14
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,862
All he did was lie.

15
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,574
Babies can't talk, though.

16
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,496
I need you to take the fall
for my most recent, uh...

17
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,916
drilling with that, uh...

18
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,501
bookie the other day.

19
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,711
Cops are sniffing around.

20
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,508
All you have to do is say you did it
and then say you're crazy.

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,550
Me?

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,096
What? You just say you went nuts.

23
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,682
Frank says, "Your Honor,
he thought he was drilling the cabinet."

24
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,311
Judge takes a look at you,
he looks at that face.

25
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,440
He says, "With a face like that,
that kid is crazy."

26
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,984
I'm your number two.

27
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,404
I'm compos mentis.
Why the fuck would I go down for this?

28
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,407
I don't know.

29
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,454
All this love in your heart, Owen.
I don't know.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,998
Makes it hard to trust you.

31
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,461
<i>Makes it very hard to trust you.</i>

32
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,798
- Hey, Frank.
- Yep.

33
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,971
You couldn't give me a couple more
of them blue pills?

34
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,765
You know,

35
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,725
as your father's consigliere,

36
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,146
I really have to advise you
to find something healthier than pills.

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,276
Like meditation, exercise.

38
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,112
‐Hey, Frank.
‐Hmm?

39
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,283
Reach into that bag
and give me some fucking pills.

40
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,048
Thank you.

41
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,260
- <i>Chapter 5,827.</i>
- You're welcome.

42
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,181
<i>Queen Gertrude
watched her prey from afar.</i>

43
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,435
<i>Biding her time, awaiting
the most delectable moment to strike.</i>

44
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,105
<i>The past had not yet relinquished
its hold on Annia,</i>

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,775
<i>as she ignored the many warnings
of the forest along the way.</i>

46
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,486
<i>Her eyes blurred by drink and greed,</i>

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,657
<i>she was unaware how many times
she'd failed the same quest</i>

48
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:24,078
<i>to guide Princess Ellia
to the Lake of the Clouds.</i>

49
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,880
I see it with my own eyes,
and its powers are unimaginable.

50
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,799
The Lake of the Clouds will heal you.

51
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,223
- Are we close?
- It's just over that next range.

52
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,477
That mythical water
will cleanse me of my sickness

53
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,729
and save me from death itself.

54
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,064
Can you feel it, Annia?

55
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,649
I...

56
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,860
My fingertips are tingling.

57
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,043
Despite the warmth of my heart,

58
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,128
the coldness of sickness,

59
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,673
death seeps through my limbs.

60
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,718
- Are your fingertips still tingling?
- Drink your soup.

61
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,649
Whenever I eat,
you only drink your spirits.

62
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,193
We all sustain ourselves
in different ways.

63
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,364
I find your company more tolerable
while drunk.

64
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,826
Would you like to hear another tale
of my homeland, Riverdale?

65
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,077
I really wouldn't, no.

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,788
When I join my ancestors in the aftertime,

67
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:53,501
I'm going to tell them of my journey
with a grumpy, good-hearted elf ranger...

68
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,212
- Half-elf.
- ...who, with mutilated ears,

69
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,674
did her best to lead
her burdensome companion to a cure.

70
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,757
First of all,

71
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,969
we are not companions.

72
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,596
This is a business arrangement,
yours and mine.

73
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,222
I guide,

74
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,685
and you follow,
and hopefully you don't die along the way.

75
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:16,691
And second-forth, I've been thinking a bit
about the terms of our initial "deal".

76
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,110
I'm going to need
at least eight more diamonds

77
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,112
to take you to the Lake of the Clouds.

78
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,240
The land is very dangerous.

79
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,701
That would be extremely painful.

80
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,578
I urinate them.

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,581
Well...

82
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,999
Oof.

83
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,125
Sorry to hear that.

84
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,254
You know, if I pissed diamonds,
I'd do it all the time.

85
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,131
But that's me.

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,816
Yeah, looks good.

87
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,485
That's NYPD property,

88
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,362
just like you, bitch.

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,658
Hey, Owen.

90
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,704
You can do this.

91
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,017
That's a nice rock.

92
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,022
How'd old Jed afford that
on a cop's salary?

93
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,692
I don't know.
Maybe he stole it from the evidence room.

94
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,612
I've gotta get a key to that room.

95
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,073
How's Rhode Island?

96
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,157
Nice up there?

97
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,618
I don't know yet.

98
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,621
- I haven't been.
- No, you just send the money.

99
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,832
- Via courier.
- Ah, to the Wambolds.

100
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,667
Yeah, to the Wambolds. Yes.

101
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,253
I'm sorry, Porter. I mean...

102
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,839
Courier gettin' jacked is on me.

103
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,342
- It's really fuckin' stupid.
- And it's never gonna happen again.

104
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,927
Never. I promise you.

105
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,929
- A one time thing.
- Mmm.

106
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,932
Mmm. Okay.

107
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,517
It's okay.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,477
Okay.

109
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,147
- Hold him down, Owen.
- Wait.

110
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,315
Okay. Okay. Okay.

111
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,693
It's okay. It's okay. Wait a minute.

112
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,571
- Wait.
- Drill, please.

113
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,632
<i>What? What are you...
What are you gonna...?</i>

114
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,451
- So, what else?
- What? Nothing, nothing. No, I swear.

115
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,619
You know why I'm the drill
and not the skull?

116
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,537
No.

117
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,140
Because I always know
when somebody's hiding something.

118
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,249
It's genetic.

119
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,042
It's my superpower.

120
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,255
All the Milgrims have one.
Mike was born with three nipples.

121
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,048
You've got three nipples?

122
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,722
Battery's dead.

123
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
You think, Phil?

124
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,519
- It's a sign.
- Who's in charge of the fucking batteries?

125
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,705
- Mike!
- Phil! I'll get one.

126
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,356
I can find it. I can find it.

127
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,155
<i>If you forgive others,
they'll forgive you.</i>

128
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,366
Your father in Heaven
will also forgive you.

129
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,412
No, you're lying again.
Fathers do not forgive.

130
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,622
But the Book of Matthew.

131
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,000
Fuck! Fuck!

132
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,170
Please, don't, don't, don't, don't.

133
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,715
Please! Blood is highly corrosive
to drill bits. Aah!

134
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes! Yes, I'm skimming.

135
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,887
I'm skimming and selling for myself.

136
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,139
Extra money to pay for a nurse.

137
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,266
I have a daughter! I have a daughter!

138
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,935
She's got special needs.

139
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,437
She's special needs!

140
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,609
Oh, yeah.

141
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,111
Temporal lobe.

142
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,285
The hippocampus.

143
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,330
Yeah!

144
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,279
Disgusting creature.

145
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,027
Fuck!

146
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,178
Shit!

147
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,168
My greatest triumphs
always go unwitnessed.

148
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,801
Hey. Ooh.

149
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,178
Okay.

150
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,223
You're hard to keep up with.

151
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,559
Oh, let me just sit down.

152
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,518
So, um,

153
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,273
these assassins that keep popping up,

154
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,526
I think they're your inner demons.

155
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,697
It's another bleedin' elf.

156
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,032
I've never seen an elf.

157
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,827
Because they don't exist, them elves.

158
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,955
And now I've seen not one but three...

159
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,038
Bye!

160
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,333
...elves in one day.

161
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,128
This one's ears is all ripped off.

162
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,630
- What do we do?
- Take them to Lady Nora.

163
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,458
<i>Fuck you! Fuck both of you!
I'm done with this fucking shit!</i>

164
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,796
He's gonna find out!
He always fucking finds out! You don't‐‐

165
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,341
Fuck, you don't understand.
He's got like a sixth sense for this shit.

166
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,729
<i>He may have someone
on the inside.</i>

167
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,764
No, we don't know that.

168
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,849
It's probably fucking you, Carl.

169
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,933
Fucking bitch.

170
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,895
Yo, I am so clean,
you can use my piss as detergent,

171
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,104
so sit on that.

172
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,471
<i>Owen, we need you.
We need you to stay with us.</i>

173
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,990
We need you to keep going.

174
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,743
Can you do that for us?

175
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,995
Can you do it for me?

176
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,081
Do I have a choice?

177
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,000
You'll go to jail.

178
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,254
This is disrespect.

179
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,214
I'm not ready to leave. Take it away.

180
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,767
Owen?

181
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,313
- What's up?
- Olivia.

182
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,148
I'm in your Age of Discovery class.

183
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,649
Yeah, I know who you are.

184
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,319
What can I get you?

185
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,765
Just some coffee. One cup of joe.

186
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,628
Thanks.

187
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,424
You know, I was gonna talk to you
at class, but...

188
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,134
since you're here...

189
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,054
I noticed you take a lot of notes...

190
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,099
and seeing as we have
that big final test coming up,

191
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,936
maybe we can study together.

192
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,271
Yeah, I'd like that.

193
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,983
- Come on, have I ever let you down?
- No, never. Wow.

194
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,861
Hey, I've got to go. No disrespect.

195
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,783
Owen, so long as we're studying together,
the coffee's on me.

196
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,370
Why are you so warm?

197
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,831
I have chronic hypothermia.

198
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,126
My skin's temperature is 106 degrees.

199
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,213
That's fucked up.

200
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,009
I've gotta go.

201
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,517
She's a long way from home.

202
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,856
- Yes, she is.
- As are you.

203
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,609
How did she find you?

204
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,902
How does anyone?

205
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,655
I was drunk in a tavern.

206
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,409
She was lost, and sick, and...

207
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,412
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

208
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:41,250
Does the princess know
the ranger she's chosen as her guide

209
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,753
is hunted by invisible assassins

210
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,922
sent by Queen Gertrude?

211
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,633
I tell Her Highness
only what she needs to know.

212
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,386
And who doesn't have a price
on their head these days?

213
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,346
She stirs.

214
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,184
Such grace.

215
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,105
How can we repay your kindness?

216
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,442
No need, my child. It is my pleasure.

217
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,111
Did my guide
tell you of our quest?

218
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,493
We seek a mythical water...

219
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,122
- that will cleanse me of my sickness.
- The Lake of the Clouds.

220
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,915
You know it?

221
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,668
I was cursed to die by my mother.

222
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,962
I came from the Riverdale forest
near death,

223
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,922
grasping at the legend.

224
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,675
Now, by the grace of the gods,

225
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,927
it seems to be coming true.

226
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,139
My ranger's going to save me
from death itself.

227
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,102
I know where it is,
and I can show you.

228
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,231
- Yurick.
- All right.

229
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,192
Up, you idiot.

230
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,027
I'm sorry, m'lady.

231
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,030
I was lost in my own head again.

232
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,466
Fetch the mirror.

233
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,575
All right, right. Thank you, thank you.

234
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,658
Who is he?

235
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,119
My husband.

236
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,496
Thank you.

237
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,124
I'd like your ranger...

238
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,128
to peer into this looking glass.

239
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,755
That's it.

240
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,091
What nature of looking glass is it?

241
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,967
Magic, of course.

242
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,012
So why not have the royal elf
look into it?

243
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,973
The glass needs
only see one of you.

244
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,017
Your fates are intertwined,

245
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,186
and I am most interested...

246
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,064
in your reflection.

247
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,033
What do you see?

248
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,369
I...

249
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,664
What is it, Annia?

250
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,828
It's two girls. Who are they?

251
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,714
Sisters.

252
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,885
The younger one is leaning forward.

253
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,847
The elder one is putting rouge on her.

254
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,528
I know this image. It's familiar.
The younger one adores the older.

255
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,191
They've heard their mother is coming home.

256
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,236
So they're getting ready.

257
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,614
But she's not really coming.

258
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,324
It's you.

259
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,543
And me.

260
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,634
How can that be?

261
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,345
Did I find you?

262
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,308
Or were you supposed to find me?

263
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,737
Follow the stars north,

264
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,322
and within two days

265
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,491
you'll reach the lightning‐struck shell
of an awin tree.

266
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,410
You'll find the lake,

267
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:07,789
so long as your eyes
and your hearts are clear.

268
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,210
I wish you luck on your quest.

269
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,627
Thank you.

270
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,421
Thank you for your help.

271
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,800
- Get up. Boil some water.
- ‐ Yes, ma'am.

272
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,555
Come, child.

273
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,017
Though you may be cursed,

274
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,645
you're still her eyes.

275
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,692
You're Greg FUN Nazlund.

276
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,781
Asshole.

277
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,790
Goodbye. Fare thee well.

278
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,629
She's very strange, that woman.

279
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,008
Did you really, you know,
see all those things that you said...

280
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,014
Did you really see all those things
you said you saw in there?

281
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,975
Ellie...

282
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,810
Ellie, it's me.

283
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,813
Look at me. It's me, Annie.

284
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,773
Yes, Annia.

285
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,608
My ranger and my guide.

286
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,153
Of course, of course, of course.

287
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,239
It's fucking fantasy.

288
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,909
It's my least favorite genre.

289
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,245
What is this?

290
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,580
What does this mean?
What is this supposed to be?

291
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,334
What does any tale mean?
My tutor used to ask me this.

292
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,464
I have read many fascinating moral tales
in the archives of the palace.

293
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,342
‐ Man, you love this.
‐Do you understand?

294
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,636
You love this. This is...

295
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,597
‐
‐This was your idea, wasn't it?

296
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,391
What? All right, come on.

297
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,101
Hey. Come on.

298
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,435
You're okay. You're okay.

299
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,319
You're probably
conspiring against me.

300
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,614
Turning my test subjects against me.

301
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,663
How are the systems running?

302
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,166
So far,
all the key indicators look perfect.

303
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,501
Whatever she's doing is helping.

304
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,297
Maybe your mother
doesn't destroy everything after all.

305
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,465
How is she?

306
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,634
She's breathing.

307
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,391
I never apologized to you about the gala.

308
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,729
You don't have to. The consequences
were simply the end of our romance.

309
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,898
I'm sorry, Azumi.

310
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,109
It was a way out.

311
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,486
A way out...

312
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:44,987
of what?

313
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,615
Failure.

314
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,122
This is the quietest I've ever seen her.

1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,649
I don't care
if you've lost your mind,

2
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,477
it's still your job to get me to the lake.

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,855
I have not lost my mind,
we are in my mind.

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,566
I think.

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,984
This is the C pill.

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,277
It's confrontation.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,363
- Annia, I'm concerned this madness is...
- I am not mad.

8
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,574
We are in a globular cluster.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,825
Okay?

10
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,952
So, you're telling me

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,330
you believe that
this is not the real world.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,249
That some other world, your world,

13
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,085
is the true world,
and that I'm confused who I am

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,964
as is every other elf, human,
orc, dwarf,

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,484
- hobgoblin, wraithling...
- Oh, my fucking God. Don't list them.

16
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,219
The entire world's mad, but you're not.

17
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,181
Is that what you think?

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,015
Yes.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,604
The other way around's more likely,
isn't it, Annia?

20
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,982
This is the place that's real.

21
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,568
Someone has cast a spell on you.

22
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,612
And it will wear off soon.

23
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,030
And if it doesn't,

24
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,158
then maybe the Lake of the Clouds
can heal you too.

25
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,328
‐ Together!
‐ Shh! Shh!

26
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,603
‐ It's her again.
‐ Oh.

27
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,897
Ah! Right when
I was about to do my solo.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,441
- Don't move. She won't see us.
- Wow.

29
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,170
‐ I have to get out of here.
‐I don't want to be eaten, guys.

30
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,630
- Go look at someone else!
- Wake up.

31
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,366
- You can't have our delicious protein!
- Come on. Wake me up, wake me up.

32
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,617
Come on, wake up!

33
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,452
Wake up!

34
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,662
What?

35
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,666
I lost you there for a second.

36
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,502
What were you thinkin' about?

37
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,880
I ain't slept in a week.

38
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,883
When's this test?

39
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,761
You've gotta stop it
with the all-nighters, Owen.

40
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,725
Have you ever heard of the Gnostics?

41
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,399
Is that when you're not sure
if God exists, like not quite an atheist?

42
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,066
No.

43
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,572
Jesus' disciples,
they all wrote gospels, right?

44
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,702
But they didn't all
make it into the Bible.

45
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,997
The church only wanted the ones

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,624
that told the story
they were trying to tell.

47
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,293
I didn't know that.

48
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,921
Well, same goes for all history.

49
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,382
Same goes for your brain.

50
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,175
What do you mean?

51
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,137
Our brains are just...

52
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,390
computers that make
our life stories make sense.

53
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,228
You know what, Owen? You...

54
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,024
are the perfect example
of never judging a book by its cover.

55
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
Why is that?

56
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,777
You know, the tattoos.

57
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,780
You look like a tough guy.

58
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,742
But you think about the world.

59
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,410
What, tough guys don't think?

60
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,620
Not usually.

61
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,497
My last boyfriend, he was...

62
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,915
into, you know...

63
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,168
criminal enterprises.

64
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,880
Kind of made him go crazy.

65
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,299
He lost his shit
and he started getting all paranoid

66
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,301
that I was workin' for the FBI,

67
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,262
and informin' on him
and recording our conversations.

68
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,722
I wasn't doin' any of that.

69
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,684
Sounds like
he was under a lot of pressure.

70
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,605
And then he really flipped out on me.

71
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,859
He started screamin' at my face,
throwin' things...

72
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,278
dumpin' out my purse, doing...

73
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,157
horrible stuff to me, it was terrifying.

74
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,247
Did he ever apologize?

75
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,332
No.

76
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,255
Actually, that's the last time
I ever heard from him.

77
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,178
Maybe he wanted to apologize but...

78
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,807
he felt too ashamed to do it.

79
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,936
Maybe it was easier for him just to...

80
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,232
pretend like it didn't even happen.

81
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,657
People can go their whole lives
pretending things didn't happen.

82
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,327
Otherwise, they'd have to admit
they're to blame

83
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,996
for everything wrong in their lives.

84
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,833
I think sometimes there's too much guilt
for one person to bear.

85
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,546
Why are you in school?

86
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,009
You already know about
Gnostics and Magellan.

87
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,594
'Cause I want somethin' different.

88
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,182
We got that in common.

89
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,977
So what do you want, then?

90
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,316
People are always askin' me
to model, right?

91
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,443
So, do that then.

92
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,989
With my chronic hypothermia,
my family says I shouldn't.

93
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,451
I'm more useful to them at home,

94
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,412
especially in the winter.

95
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,707
For people who are supposed
to love unconditionally...

96
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,712
families seem to have a lot of conditions.

97
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,302
One day I wanna make
a family with no conditions.

98
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,973
Maybe that's all I really want.

99
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,771
Talking to you is really easy, Olivia.

100
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,984
You too, Owen.

101
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,222
You see, she was telling the truth.

102
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,016
If there was no lake,
why would we have found the tree?

103
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,102
No, it's just part of the con.

104
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,605
Someone must have told fur lady
how I do it.

105
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,190
I bring them here,

106
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,484
I wow them with the Burning Tree,

107
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,237
and I tell them to look
for the invisible moon, but...

108
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,657
they can't see it
because there isn't one and so...

109
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:48,991
magic!

110
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,952
I can see it.

111
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,536
Have a look.

112
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,872
There obviously isn't...

113
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,877
the moon.

114
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,882
Can you see it, too?

115
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,716
Yeah.

116
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,639
I don't usually even
bring people that way.

117
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,181
Come along.

118
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,645
God.

119
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,674
Hey, Ron, make sure you put
those tennis shoes in the furnace.

120
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,843
Let's roll out that periwinkle cuff.

121
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,886
- It's kind of calm.
- How'd those new pills work?

122
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,722
- You sleep any better?
- No.

123
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,932
No? Try the red ones next time.

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,518
Talk to me if you need somethin' else.

125
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,439
Well, I found the rat.

126
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,901
Your own brother.

127
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,195
Can you fuckin' believe it?

128
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,657
Aah, I'm slippin'.

129
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,743
No way Rick was the rat.

130
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,953
What the fuck were you doin'?

131
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,414
Oh, by the way, I've got this new system.

132
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,498
Okay?

133
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,294
When you're finished,
you put it directly into the charger,

134
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,298
and then when you need a new one,
you take it out, you put it in the drill.

135
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,841
That way, you never...

136
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,177
You have no idea what's goin' on, do you?

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,181
You never had
a fuckin' sixth-sense superpower.

138
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,020
Have you ever considered that,
despite all your problems here...

139
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,857
it's likely that you are currently trapped

140
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,026
inside a malfunctioning

141
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,696
and extremely dangerous simulation,

142
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,074
which is, in itself, directed

143
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,826
by a suicidally depressed
consciousness?

144
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,871
Why?

145
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>Ceci n'est pas une</i> fucking <i>drill.</i>

146
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,047
So...

147
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,553
What are you gonna do
about protecting the family?

148
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,140
I ain't crazy,
and I ain't gonna say that I am.

149
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,564
You are failing the big test.

150
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,068
<i>I did have a sister.</i>

151
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,112
What was she like?

152
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,406
I hated to...

153
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,283
get clean when I was little.

154
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,118
There was the day...

155
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,994
in the river.

156
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,290
We built a dam with wolf pups.

157
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,793
The Derglassian brothers,

158
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,755
from the farm two miles up the road.

159
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,512
And by the end, we were...

160
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,141
covered in mud and...

161
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,976
and clay, and...

162
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,228
And dog hair.

163
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,897
And Mother was there.

164
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
And she just looked at the both of us...

165
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,735
and said...

166
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,489
"I'm the mother of two filthy...

167
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,366
roaches.

168
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,743
I will...

169
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,996
drown you both...

170
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,041
before you set foot in this house."

171
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,293
She was in that sundress.

172
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,129
Havin' a day.

173
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,425
Then you ran away.

174
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,803
Did I ever tell you
what she said to me after?

175
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,471
No.

176
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,059
She asked me
why hadn't I run away as well?

177
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,645
And I said it was out of respect.

178
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,858
Even though, really, it was
because I was more afraid than you.

179
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,112
She swiped her finger across my forehead

180
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,573
and asked what she'd done

181
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,867
to deserve a daughter like me.

182
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,995
And I asked her what she meant.

183
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,209
And she said, "Utterly and predictably...

184
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,709
normal."

185
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,841
Well, it's better than being hit.

186
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,646
<i>If we move now,
you can promise me another body?</i>

187
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,250
How about an apron with four
different motherfuckers' blood on it?

188
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,151
Murder's not enough.

189
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,739
It's gotta be.

190
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,577
You can't push him anymore.

191
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,292
Roosevelt, 088.

192
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,671
- <i>Password?</i>
- Wendy.

193
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,506
<i>- Green light.
- Utangátta.</i>

194
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,426
Hey. What... what does that mean?
What is that word?

195
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,761
‐None of your damn business.
‐You think, uh...

196
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,389
your dad knew something?

197
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,226
- What?
- I mean your brother, Rick.

198
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,437
That's who your dad thought it was, right?

199
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,314
- I'm the rat.
- Yeah, but there could be others.

200
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,941
You never know about Interpol.

201
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,736
Shouldn't you know?
Why don't you fuckin' know?

202
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,822
Calm down, Owen. You're just
a little square in this jigsaw puzzle.

203
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,409
Hey, jigsaw pieces are not squares,
you dumb motherfucker.

204
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,871
- Easy, white boy.
- Okay. Owen, take a breath.

205
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,710
It's gonna be okay.

206
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,172
- It's gonna be okay.
- Don't coddle him.

207
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,091
- Turn down service.
‐ Okay, that's him.

208
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,469
All right, let's get this done.

209
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,556
- Hi.
- Hey.

210
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,259
‐Baby, what are you doing here? It's not...
‐I'm sorry.

211
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,441
What the fuck?

212
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,026
- Hi.
- Hey.

213
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,613
Get on the bed.

214
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,307
You don't see it, do you?

215
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,685
I'm your brother.

216
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
Hello! Jed!

217
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,565
Grimsson!

218
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,401
The fifth Milgrim boy.

219
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,073
Shunned, abandoned,
black sheep, prodigal son.

220
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,741
Lying fucking eyes. Huh.

221
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,786
Dad never told you.

222
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,914
He said he got rid of you
'cause you were an un-loyal baby.

223
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,332
That's why Dad's a genius.

224
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,168
It wasn't because of that.

225
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,797
It's because he...
he needed a cop with the bloodline.

226
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,484
Do you wanna know why, Owen?

227
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,638
Because nothing trumps blood.

228
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,392
At least‐‐
Yeah, at least, I thought so...

229
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,894
I've watched you my whole life.

230
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,357
I wanna be you.

231
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,486
I love you.

232
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,657
Owen, the prince.

233
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,328
It ain't that great being me, dude.

234
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,377
What? You... you sad about her?

235
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,924
Yeah, it's 'cause she's attractive.

236
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,511
I was gonna marry her.

237
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,473
Why the fuck you shoot her, then?

238
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,895
Blood trumps cock, right?

239
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,563
Oh! Fuck.

240
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,065
Need to stretch more...

241
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,349
What are you doing he... Fuck!

242
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,075
Brilliantly played, Owen.

243
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,411
Thanks for the breadcrumbs.

244
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,538
Is she dead?

245
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,334
- Yeah.
- Shame.

246
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,378
There's some spare shirts in the car.

247
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,941
<i>This whole time, you've just been
a motherfuckin' fed, dude.</i>

248
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,693
<i>I've been undercover
for 36 years now.</i>

249
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,236
Are you fucking kidding me?

250
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Fucking moron!

251
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,366
<i>So we're gonna need you
to testify.</i>

252
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,409
<i>We'll put in you into witness relocation.</i>

253
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,039
<i>I wanna bring someone with me
when I go into witness relocation.</i>

254
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,382
Luigi, there wasn't
supposed to be bacon on that.

255
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,968
Also, there's a hair in this.
Is this table number nine?

256
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,302
- Hey.
- Owen.

257
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,138
- I'm leaving.
- Leaving? I didn't know you were here.

258
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,502
Why is there blood on your face?

259
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,809
You need to do somethin' different, right?

260
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,060
Yeah.

261
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,479
You wanna see the world, do stuff, right?

262
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,854
Yeah.

263
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,481
So, come with me.

264
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,483
Where?

265
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,112
They'll give us both brand-new identities.

266
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,280
‐Who? Who will?
‐

267
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,448
The FBI.

268
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,578
- No, I can't... I can't go with you.
- Is this her?

269
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,432
‐ I'm not done yet.
- You comin', hon, or what?

270
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,476
‐ Who is this guy?
- I'm Frank. Who the fuck are you?

271
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,336
Hey, don't fuckin' talk to her like that,
you understand?

272
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,425
There are so many reasons to say no.

273
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,177
You asked me what I wanted.

274
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,471
And I said something different.

275
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,849
Marry me.

276
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,061
Hey, I wan't you to marry me, Olivia.

277
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,856
I fuckin' love you.

278
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,066
No conditions?

279
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,861
No conditions.

280
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,533
Okay.

281
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,201
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

282
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,370
- Hey, she fuckin' said yes!
<i>- Mazel tov!</i>

283
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,456
My motherfuckin' superpower is love!

284
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,254
Asia, stop it!

285
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,590
Antarctica, just grab this.

286
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,676
Africa, enough with the glue!
We don't have to scream like that.

287
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,680
Australia. Australia, stop it, please.
Stop it.

288
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,183
- That's ridiculous.
- I asked him whether or not...

289
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,269
Don't, Africa. I see you, okay?

290
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,855
Stop it!

291
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,483
Australia, enough. Enough with the drum!

292
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,566
<i>Utangátta!</i>

293
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,489
We had a pretty good life, you know.

294
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,324
But I realized last night...

295
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,415
none of it matters.

296
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,504
I ain't supposed to be here with y'all.

297
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,382
I can't be the person
I'm supposed to be here.

298
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,930
Goodbye, everybody.

299
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,013
What?

300
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,349
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,310
- What does he mean by...
- Owen. What...

302
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,437
Dad? Dad, no!

303
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,734
<i>...look out for each other,
remember?</i>

304
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,198
<i>You made a promise to me.</i>

305
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,742
<i>And you made a promise to yourself.</i>

306
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,496
<i>We promised we'd look out for each other,
remember?</i>

307
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,669
<i>You made a promise to me.</i>

308
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,421
<i>And you made a promise to yourself.</i>

309
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,967
<i>We promised we'd look out for each other,
remember?</i>

310
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,335
Don't you think
you're being a little dramatic?

311
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,835
<i>You made a promise to me.</i>

312
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,310
You're really gonna leave me here
with seven children?

313
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,439
<i>We promised
we'd look out for each other, remember?</i>

314
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,358
I know where I'm supposed to be now.

315
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,572
<i>You made a promise to me.</i>

316
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,199
<i>And you made a promise to yourself.</i>

317
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,911
<i>We promised we'd look out for each other,
remember?</i>

318
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,382
<i>Annie, I'm coming for you!</i>

319
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,809
<i>This place goes on forever!</i>

320
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,648
<i>Annie, where are you?</i>

321
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,031
<i>Annie, I'm a hawk!</i>

322
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,491
This is it.

323
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,078
This is the place.

324
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,829
Where I died.

325
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,916
I don't want to see.

326
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,461
You have to look.

327
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,008
This is how you move on.

328
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,347
And it's time to say goodbye.

329
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,851
- I can't say goodbye to you.
- You have to.

330
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,436
- I can't.
- You have to.

331
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,818
<i>It doesn't matter what they want.</i>

332
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,655
I'm here with you now, and right now,
it's all about what you want.

333
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,324
Which is to say, what I want.

334
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,204
What I really need is a friend.

335
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,334
And I think you could use one too.

336
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,462
I...

337
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,549
fell in love.

338
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
And‐‐ and then I lost...

339
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,429
Robert, and...

340
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,887
and I don't‐‐

341
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,600
I don't know how, I don't know how I can...
how I can‐‐

342
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,102
Oh!

343
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,022
Oh! So many new emotions.

344
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,649
One minute, I feel like I'm gonna cry,

345
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,736
and the next minute
I feel like I wanna help everybody,

346
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,197
and then the next, I wanna do
as much damage as possible.

347
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,120
Well, that's a little over the top,
don't you think, all in all?

348
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,418
This is all your hysteria, Greta.

349
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,503
It's all you.

350
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,504
So...

351
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,508
So, what, thi... thi...
this woman with the legs

352
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,845
thinks she can slap a few toddler emotions
into a Speak &amp; Spell

353
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,805
and create a mind, my mind?

354
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,435
You describe your feelings
as toddler emotions?

355
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,520
You're a machine, a computer.

356
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,398
How much of me can actually be in there?

357
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,276
I'm detecting
a great deal of anger from you, Greta.

358
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,821
James? James.

359
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,162
James, let me out!

360
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,083
Jamie!

361
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:02,047
James. James. James, James, James!

362
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,008
James, James! Oh! Oh! Oh!

363
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,177
What's a McMurphy?

364
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,262
Uh...

365
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,808
<i>What is this place?</i>

366
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,393
<i>Beautiful!</i>

367
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,187
<i>Annie, I'm coming!</i>

368
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,777
The Queen.

369
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,244
It's her.

370
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,914
- You have to say goodbye right now.
- No.

371
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,374
- You have to.
- No!

372
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,502
You shouldn't ever have to say goodbye.

373
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,256
I have a deal for you, Annie,
if you're interested.

374
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:49,261
What if I said you never had
to return to your drab, gray life?

375
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:54,307
All that obsession with knowing
who you are, knowing yourself...

376
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,436
True bliss is not knowing who you are.

377
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,564
True bliss is staying here.

378
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,108
That's what I have to offer.

379
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,946
Annie, it's me, Owen, as a hawk!

380
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,240
I haven't forgotten,
we'll protect each...

381
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,804
She's lying. Don't make a deal with...

382
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,707
We'll just send him back
to the Globular Cluster.

383
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,758
What if I said
you could stay here with us?

384
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,802
Forever and ever.

385
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,138
Stay with your sister.

386
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,974
Don't do this again.
You wanna move on. Just say goodbye.

387
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,893
No. No.

388
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,369
Wait. Wait, what about Ellie?

389
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,996
Ellie!

390
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,750
No! No!

391
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,627
Wait! Wait!

392
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,754
Ellie!

393
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,339
No, please wait!

394
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,092
No! Ellie! Ellie!

395
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,929
Ellie! Ellie!

396
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,895
I'm sorry, you misunderstood.

397
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,065
<i>This is an exclusive deal.</i>

398
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,819
<i>We'll be together forever.</i>

1
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,858
NATO HEADQUARTERS
BRUSSELS, BELGIUM

2
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,301
Before we begin this negotiation,

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,404
the temporary administrative

4
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,909
adjunct assistant
to the Consulate of Iceland,

5
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,079
Snorri Agnarsson, will confirm his guilt.

6
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,082
Yes, I am guilty.

7
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,168
I have prepared a small statement.

8
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,427
"Thank you. Because of my incompetence,

9
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,181
I should be placed in the cone of a rocket

10
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,266
and launched into space,

11
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,812
so that Ernie's folk may punish me

12
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,023
in whatever manner they deem correct.

13
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,649
Thank you."

14
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,657
There's a there there.
That Snorri be symbolically sacrificed

15
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,033
to the aliens,

16
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,911
the lamb that may prevent
the Earth's slaughter.

17
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,047
Does he deserve to die?
He discovered Ernie, for crying out loud.

18
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,217
I feel as though I've lost
a member of my family.

19
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,554
Ernie's folk will want an explanation,

20
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,598
and they have a right to know
what happened to little Ernie.

21
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,851
Before I die,

22
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,061
may I please tell them?

23
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,438
Good point. Explain yourself.

24
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,482
Start the recording.

25
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,194
I was born
not far from Reykjavík.

26
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,446
My parents were afraid of me,

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,117
- and were emotionally withholding...
- Only the pertinent details.

28
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,246
My mother was an Austrian Finnish Swede,

29
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,250
and my father
was Dutch-Italian-Icelandic,

30
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,377
hence my unique accent.

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,963
Pertinent details regarding Ernie.

32
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,341
While on a birding expedition,

33
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,429
I discovered teeny, tiny
little Ernie, wounded.

34
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,600
At first, I believed he was a<i> huldufólk...</i>

35
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,935
the little people.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,397
He was two feet tall
and humanoid in appearance,

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,152
but he had this beautiful
bluish exoskeleton

38
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,488
with fine orange decorative elements.

39
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,740
He was stunning.

40
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,035
I brought him home,
I cared for him, I tit-fed him.

41
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,537
I nursed him back to health.

42
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,831
And then I notified Admiral Grimsson,

43
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,750
a birding friend of mine.

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,585
Given current geo...

45
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,088
political tensions...

46
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,013
the goal was to craft an agreement

47
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,225
to safely introduce Ernie to the world.

48
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:50,563
He told us his species would eliminate
every problem humanity has ever faced.

49
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,817
And did you believe what he said?
That he meant mankind no harm?

50
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,901
Yes.

51
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,405
He cured a cancer
in Admiral Grimsson's daughter,

52
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,118
and he talked General Banner
through the equation of arborization,

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,287
a form of time and space travel.

54
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,921
Don't worry, Sokolov. It's all up here.

55
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,840
Snorri, please continue.

56
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,843
We were preparing to make
the announcement in the morning.

57
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,179
Tonight, we were celebrating.

58
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,728
<i>I was drinking a gimlet,
and Admiral Grimsson toasted.</i>

59
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,398
<i>I think he's a very accomplished dancer.</i>

60
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,067
<i>And Ernie was going to give a speech.</i>

61
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,015
What happened next, Snorri?

62
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,828
I'm sorry?

63
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,584
Mr. Agnarsson,
could you please speak up?

64
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,085
I...

65
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,628
I...

66
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,615
I-I can't... What are you saying?

67
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:11,371
I electrocuted him!

68
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,962
No, it was not on purpose!

69
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,091
It was a faulty microphone I provided him.

70
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,594
Or maybe it was my gimlet. Who knows?

71
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,263
- [rumbling
- But this is Snorri's fault.

72
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,610
Here, sir.

73
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,163
We've received word that a large mass

74
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,457
has moved past the moon

75
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,710
and a heat ray has been focused
on the Earth.

76
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,841
It's Ernie's people.
They've come back for revenge.

77
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,258
Gentlemen...

78
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,471
looks like the Earth is fucked.

79
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,015
Take Snorri away.

80
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,227
It's my fault.

81
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,020
I'm sorry, Belgium.

82
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,439
I'm sorry, Canada.

83
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,149
I'm sorry, Denmark.

84
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,072
I'm sorry, France.

85
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm sorry, Germany.

86
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm sorry, Iceland.

87
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
I'm sorry...

88
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,533
Which one are you?

89
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,033
Luxembourg.

90
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,378
I'm not seeing anything
out of the ordinary.

91
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,629
Nor am I.

92
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,007
Safety Net's fully engaged. They're fine.

93
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,426
How are our thermals?

94
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,471
Slightly elevated.
Average of 99.1.

95
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,848
Exactly in line with C protocol.

96
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,931
Good.

97
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,569
Oh.

98
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,282
Maybe you misunderstood
what Gertie said.

99
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,910
I know you build minds, dear,

100
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,496
but I have been attuned to them
my whole life.

101
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,164
I understand what people are saying

102
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,127
better than they understand
what they're saying.

103
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,794
Your computer is suffering
from pathological bereavement.

104
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,672
She's cycling through delusional emotions.

105
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,467
In the time I sat with her,
she went from thinking she was a god,

106
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,344
to thinking she was a subject
in your trial,

107
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,805
to weeping about being so lonely.

108
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,891
I think she's lost her mind.

109
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,100
So why did you leave?

110
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,270
Because she started talking
about keeping your subjects prisoner,

111
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,814
about toying with them, hurting them.

112
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,858
I told her this was
completely unacceptable.

113
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,527
She got angry and threw me out.

114
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,570
I mean, she literally
threw me out the window.

115
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,364
I woke up when I hit the sidewalk.

116
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,116
I just went through another diagnostic.

117
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,622
We're nowhere near
a Heinz catatonic horizon.

118
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,831
See?

119
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,334
The subjects are fine.

120
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,461
She's not collecting McMurphies.

121
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,922
The computer's behavior
is completely normal.

122
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:13,302
It's usually the people who appear normal
who are feeling the most primal terror.

123
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,971
And what's yours, Suzuki?

124
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,599
Mother, leave her alone.
We're trying to solve a problem here.

125
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,684
What is your point?

126
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,728
The point is,
just because she's your offspring

127
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,605
doesn't make it any less true.

128
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,732
Stop covering for her.

129
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,319
Take a look at your blind spot
and do what's right.

130
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,574
- Mother!
- What is at stake is too important.

131
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,954
You think those pills
are gonna fix you one day, don't you?

132
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,374
The G.R.T.A. is not my offspring.

133
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,585
She is a system I designed,

134
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,004
far more elegant and effective

135
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,299
than any of your dime-store theories
of bliss.

136
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,468
You were right.
I was foolish to let her come here.

137
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,262
I wouldn't trust a word this woman says.

138
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,432
She's trying to sabotage this trial
because she's jealous.

139
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,683
She's jealous of Gertie

140
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,019
because she'll help more people
than she ever has,

141
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,771
she's jealous of you
because you'll be responsible for it,

142
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,108
and she's jealous of me
because I have you.

143
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,073
Uh...

144
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,705
What a ridiculous speech.

145
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,998
Throw her out, James.

146
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,174
You have to shut this trial down
immediately.

147
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,342
Calm down.

148
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,385
No, I can't shut it down.

149
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,804
If I shut it down now,
everything will be lost.

150
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,098
The whole project would be dead.

151
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,143
While I'm sure nothing
would make you happier

152
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,563
than to see my progress
completely eradicated, Mother,

153
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,776
I must say, this is a little selfish
and a bit much, even for you.

154
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,944
Why the mind?

155
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,822
- What?
- Jamie, why the mind?

156
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,284
Of all the professions
you could have picked...

157
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,038
why choose the one that I'm in?

158
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,749
I am a neurochemist.

159
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,210
I am a medical doctor.

160
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,128
You're not a very good medical doctor.

161
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,507
You're forgetting the Hippocratic Oath,
if you ever knew it.

162
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,717
"First do no harm."

163
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,887
You're not protecting
those people in there.

164
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,765
- Stop diminishing me!
- Why won't you believe me?

165
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,518
You call me, you ask me
to come and help you.

166
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,354
Why won't you ever listen to your mother?

167
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,400
Because you are an awful mother!

168
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,569
Because you left me alone,

169
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,613
and you drove my father away,

170
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,491
and you slept in my bed way too much,

171
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,619
and you said things
that should never be said to a child.

172
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,001
Ugh. And on the happiest day of my life,
the day I was handed this lab,

173
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,793
the only thing
that you could think to say to me

174
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:55,756
was that my happiness
was all just a fucking ill... illusion.

175
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,261
I can't...

176
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,097
I can't see.

177
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,142
Can't see what?

178
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,519
- I can't see.
- Well, I made it perfectly clear.

179
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,645
I've gone blind!

180
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,480
- Oh. Well, just...
- Oh, my God!

181
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,816
- Calm down now.
- I've gone blind!

182
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,360
- Just take a deep breath. It's...
- I can't see!

183
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,320
- No, it's...
- Azumi!

184
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,489
It's psychosomatic.
Your eyes are perfectly good.

185
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,075
I don't believe
in psychosomatic conditions.

186
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,243
Let... let me hug you.

187
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,762
- No! Don't hug me.
- Let me hug you.

188
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,847
- Get off of me!
- It will...

189
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,456
This is psychosomatic.

190
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,219
You've maimed me!

191
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,459
What have you done to me?

192
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,294
LEISURE TIME

193
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,014
END TIME

194
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,016
What have you done?

195
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,102
You've made me into a monster!

196
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,103
I can't see, Mom.

197
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,647
- Are you...
- I need you to let go of me right now.

198
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,443
- Please!
- You don't need those pills.

199
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,404
Took that man two whole days
to blow this motherfucker up.

200
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,490
- This will heal you.
- Mm-hm.

201
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,174
You must die, Snorri.

202
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,141
Hi.

203
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,270
I do not care if you are here to kill me.

204
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,689
I was already going to kill myself.

205
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,484
I am risking my cover to help you, Snorri.

206
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,656
Oh.

207
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,912
The CIA has ordered me to be your escort,

208
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,540
what with the looming
alien invasion and all.

209
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,833
Huh?

210
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,419
That squishy little space man you killed
was not here to help humanity.

211
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:02,007
He and his species
want to filet and sell humankind

212
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,718
as exotic meats across the galaxy.

213
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,470
He was here to kill us all.

214
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,014
And unfortunately, the little fucker

215
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,018
passed the codes to Banner
before you popped him.

216
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,058
No!

217
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,980
Forbidden speech
about my dear friend Ernie!

218
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:21,360
He was the most gentle, empathic,
kind little friend I ever had.

219
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,487
He was a babe, he was beautiful.

220
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,407
- God.
- We would walk along the sand,

221
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,910
and he would tell me secrets
about the stars.

222
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,871
Well, none of it was true.

223
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,747
And that's not all.

224
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,888
You're not human.
Yes, you have a human body,

225
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,427
but your consciousness is alien.

226
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,013
What are you doing?

227
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,222
Just sit still.

228
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,937
Your true self is here to stop Ernie.

229
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,189
Snorri's just your cover.

230
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,026
There's a whole other person
underneath him.

231
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,368
You just can't remember.

232
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,997
Lucky I'm here to wake you up.

233
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,333
And who are you?

234
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,960
No idea. Most of my memories were wiped

235
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,255
when I was tortured by the CIA
and turned into a killing machine.

236
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,887
So neither of us know who we truly are.

237
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,265
We are the same.

238
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,725
Correct.

239
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,019
Now I have to get you
to the extragalactic radio

240
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,772
so we can unlock a portal for your forces.

241
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,363
This is too much to process for Snorri.

242
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,991
All right, let's think.

243
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:59,416
Tell me what the Icelandic word
<i>Utangátta </i>means.

244
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,587
- It means something is amiss.
- No.

245
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,714
Tell me what it means to you.

246
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,260
To Snorri, it means...

247
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,685
every relationship I have had,

248
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,311
old or new...

249
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,857
has somehow been false.

250
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,320
And I've always felt invisible...

251
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,281
hidden from the world...

252
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,451
like an Egyptian nightjar.

253
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,832
And all of this makes me tremendously...

254
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,334
sad right now.

255
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,004
There it is.

256
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,380
The nosebleed.

257
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
Good sign.

258
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,385
Ooh!

259
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,973
Wow!

260
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,686
Come on.

261
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,273
Wow, you are very good at gun!

262
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,356
I know.

263
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,818
We're losing him!

264
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,158
- Wow!
- Get me one.

265
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,241
Yes!

266
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,370
- Thank you.
- Who are these people?

267
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,205
Oh, I call 'em inner demons.

268
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,332
- Wow!
- It seems like you got some too.

269
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,510
Yes!

270
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,138
Whoo!

271
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,348
Back up.

272
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,727
You have an unusual amount of demons
following you, Snorri.

273
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,161
Wow.

274
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,622
It is hotter
than the Reykjadalur spring!

275
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,165
Oh, that'll be the heat ray.

276
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,504
I killed lots of men!

277
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,587
Good job.

278
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,978
You are very good.

279
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,064
- You're good!
- Duck!

280
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,024
Hold this.

281
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,070
All right, we're going
to level negative 65.

282
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,989
There is no such thing
as level negative 65.

283
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,073
Oh, shit.

284
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,159
Wait. They changed it.

285
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,538
Here we go.

286
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,170
Thank you
for such an exhilarating experience.

287
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,924
I must visit your Texas.

288
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,635
Not in here, Snorri.

289
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,804
You're an exciting woman!

290
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,431
Very fun!

291
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,362
Are you sure our temperature readings
are accurate?

292
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,782
Five-by-five on all my readouts.

293
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,369
MANUAL

294
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,587
Give me a true mercury reading.

295
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,463
Fuck!

296
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,322
That's impossible. It's 140 degrees.

297
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,723
Where are our alarms?

298
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,309
The feedback data is not reliable.

299
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,229
For fuck's sake.

300
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,439
She's locked us in.

301
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,982
LEISURE TIME

302
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,066
SEIZURE TIME

303
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,780
Oh, shit. Everyone, get in your pods.

304
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,871
Now!

305
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,084
All right, you heard Carl.
Everybody...

306
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,129
- We got smoke.
- Carl, I know.

307
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,132
I need you to manually trigger
the emergency ventilation system.

308
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,484
- How?
- I'll talk you through it.

309
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,551
Go to the mainframe.

310
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,553
Five, six, seven, eight.

311
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,141
<i>Gasumasuku.</i>

312
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,398
<i>To trigger
the emergency ventilation system,</i>

313
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,111
<i>you have to enter the override sequence.</i>

314
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,115
<i>On my mark. Gamma, gamma, pulse, enter.</i>

315
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,202
- Got it.
- Check their pulses.

316
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,455
<i>- They're alive.</i>
- Good.

317
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,417
Now Gertie needs a timeout.
Pull the red override knob.

318
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,758
Holy fucking shit!

319
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,558
Code epsilon.

320
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,272
Ah! Azumi!

321
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,734
Now, have any Soviets
had access to your rectum?

322
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,027
My rectum?

323
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,747
God Almighty.

324
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,002
- Who was she?
- Now, I need you to stand still.

325
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,213
You understand?
It's time to retrieve the recall trigger.

326
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,551
You are going to insert this
into my body cavities?

327
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,761
- No.
- This is madness.

328
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,430
I loved Ernie.

329
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,517
If I was a secret agent,
I would know I was a secret agent.

330
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,227
It's in the knee.
It's in the knee!

331
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,438
You're stronger than you think.

332
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,440
You remember when you were nine

333
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,526
and you accidentally electrocuted Freyja
with that car battery?

334
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,153
That was a test run.

335
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,822
Out. Out.

336
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,698
Out!

337
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,843
Popcorn problems.

338
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,681
Hey, buddy, you like nuts? Yeah.

339
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,558
Yeah, you're my best friend.

340
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,268
You're my best friend.

341
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,355
And you're my best friend,
and you're my best friend too.

342
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:37,938
Annie.

343
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,610
It's me, Annie.

344
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,529
What happened to your accent?

345
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,739
We are in a test.

346
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,407
We are in the lab.

347
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,869
- No, we're in NATO.
- That is not what's happening.

348
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,454
I turned into the hawk.

349
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,955
I came here to warn you.

350
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,291
This is the confrontation.

351
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,585
The computer is all effed up.

352
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,545
What computer?

353
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,298
You made a deal with her to never wake up.

354
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,008
Sir.

355
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,053
Good to see you again.

356
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,696
I'm sorry I couldn't be the one
to give you a nosebleed.

357
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,808
But she's more real to you now.

358
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,227
- How do you two know each other?
- In good time.

359
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,062
Good work wakin' him up.

360
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,939
Next we got to make you see the light.

361
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,484
Oh, the nexus is rumbling.

362
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,362
This whole fuckin' shitshow. Let's go.

363
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,613
Let's go.

364
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,936
Don't know why our host
hasn't shown her face.

365
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,190
- So many goddamn mysteries!
- Hey. How do you know him?

366
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,285
He's my handler.

367
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,723
Hope you don't mind
the smell of house pets.

368
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,249
McMURPHY ROOM
CHAMBRE McMURPHY

369
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,337
What is this place?

370
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,506
This is where she keeps
her long-term patients.

371
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,590
Who does?

372
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,467
Gertie, the computer.

373
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:48,927
Jesus.

374
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,264
She keeps them as her entourage
for when she crashes your reflections.

375
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,684
But really, they're prisoners. All of 'em
brain-dead up in the real world.

376
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,644
She told me she was gonna keep you.

377
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,730
Then you made a deal with her to stay.

378
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,942
ANNIE LANDSBERG
73-9

379
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,611
You were with your sister.

380
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,364
You were about to say goodbye.

381
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,202
I remember.

382
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,874
Annie, your nose is bleeding.

383
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,423
Where would I find Gertie,
if I needed to talk to her?

384
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,800
The elevator should get you to her.

385
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,761
I'm sorry.

386
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,559
- Annie, wait.
- Let her go.

387
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,478
It's fine, it's fine.

388
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,314
- She always leaves.
- It's okay, she got you here.

389
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,192
Besides, if you get distracted by her,
we're all dead.

390
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,818
Listen. God, fuck.

391
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,821
If you really wanna help her...

392
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,199
the best thing you do is come with me.

393
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,037
If you fail, her brain is fried up
in the lab just like yours.

394
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,256
Let's go. Oh, come on.

395
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,301
Oh, come on.

396
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,699
Azumi!

397
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,161
Azumi, what the fuck is going on?

398
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,413
What's wrong with you?

399
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,582
Huh?

400
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,126
I've been blinded
by my mother's toxic love.

401
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,587
I have no control whatsoever.

402
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,256
What's happening, James?

403
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,840
It's a code epsilon.

404
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,219
I was right. I was right.
I was right. I was right.

405
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,720
Would you be quiet, please?

406
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,056
We're trapped in here. It's Gertie.

407
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,810
Shut down the power,
including the emergency backup.

408
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,063
But, James, I don't think
you understand the implications

409
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,482
if we shut down during code epsilon.

410
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,862
Fuck this fucking heat.
You're not hot?

411
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,364
It took me a bit of time,

412
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,700
but I figured out a way
to deactivate Gertie.

413
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,368
We're gonna have to do it fast.

414
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,788
Actually, you are.
I can't do a fuckin' Rubik's Cube.

415
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,540
Here it is. Sit down.

416
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,469
I'm tired of you trying to run away.

417
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,053
Oh.

418
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,888
Oh!

419
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,849
Oh!

420
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,562
The minute Robert died, I felt the wind.

421
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,149
I never felt wind before.

422
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,694
And it was cold, it blew right through me.

423
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,613
Do you know that feeling?

424
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,282
Sure, of course.

425
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,301
You're controlling all of this,
aren't you?

426
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,710
I'm not really in control of this place.

427
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,920
But we're safe, still, right?

428
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,049
You said you'd stay with me.

429
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,133
We made a deal.

430
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,885
I know.

431
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,222
But I changed my mind.

432
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,142
Why?

433
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,606
Because it was a bad deal.

434
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,234
I make bad deals all the time.

435
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,153
You knew that...

436
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,156
and you used that.

437
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,951
But I don't want to pretend
Ellie didn't die.

438
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,580
Not anymore.

439
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,629
It's the same story every time,
and I am sick of it.

440
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,756
So please...

441
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,134
Please let me go.

442
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,723
When will I stop feeling this way
about Robert?

443
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,684
You won't.

444
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,146
You're always gonna feel this way.

445
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,507
You're just gonna have to figure out
how to adjust around it.

446
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,696
I've looked into 882 minds.

447
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,323
I don't know how I'm supposed
to adjust to that.

448
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,574
Nobody does.

449
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,119
Take me to my sister.

450
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,497
Okay.

451
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,709
Okay.

452
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,964
Okay.

453
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,881
What is this?

454
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,926
It's an intergalactic radio.

455
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,179
Really, it's a backdoor link
to Lab C's security system.

456
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,306
It's too... it's too...

457
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,558
Come on, take this off.

458
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,061
I need you to focus. Come on.

459
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,860
Solve this, and it should unlock the doors
for them upstairs.

460
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,111
You can do it.

461
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,947
Six sides, six stages.

462
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,787
MONARCH PASS
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE

463
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,105
Save them. This is what
we always talk about,

464
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,690
this is what the training was for.

465
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,526
Save the world. Save Annie.

466
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Save yourself.

467
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,575
<i>...shut down the...</i>

468
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,952
What'll happen to you?

469
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,121
I'll stay for now.

470
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,458
But that's better for you.

471
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,085
Who are you?

472
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,425
You always thought of me
as the brother you wish you had, right?

473
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,137
Maybe I'm that.

474
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,183
Or maybe my purpose
was just to get you to this moment.

475
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,229
<i>It's erased for good.</i>

476
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,441
- I don't understand.
- It's okay. It's okay.

477
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,942
Come on.

478
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,237
Come on, don't get distracted.

479
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,668
You found me again.

480
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,505
Took me a while.

481
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,092
I know.

482
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,552
That's why I'm still here.

483
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,684
So, what do you wanna say?

484
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,692
I, um... I'm sorry.

485
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,403
I'm sorry that I was drunk
at your funeral.

486
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,366
I'm sorry I lost Groucho.

487
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,495
I'm sorry I'm such a shitty dog-sitter.

488
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,499
None of that stuff matters.

489
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,048
I'm sorry I was so awful to you
at the motel.

490
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,595
I was afraid.

491
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,640
Why wouldn't you take the picture?

492
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,644
Um, I...

493
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,189
I don't know. I don't know.

494
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,773
Yes, you do.

495
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,362
We always get to this spot,

496
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,448
but we never get past it.

497
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,075
What does that mean?

498
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,371
It means...

499
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,957
say what you really mean.

500
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,250
I wouldn't take the picture

501
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,376
because it broke my heart that you were leaving New
York, and... I wasn't gonna get to see you anymore.

502
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,100
You were the only one
who knew all my stories.

503
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,562
You were the only person
that knew about Mom.

504
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,695
How am I supposed to do this?

505
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,658
Remember what you told me...

506
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,869
the day that Mom left?

507
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,789
We walked back to the house,

508
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,375
and you showed me how to bake that cake?

509
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,962
I don't want to say that.

510
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,714
That's not gonna work for me.

511
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,969
I'm tired too.

512
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,640
I wanna go.

513
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,234
I said, "Sometimes people leave
and we don't know why."

514
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,125
Good luck.

515
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,435
Come on.

516
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,780
- I said kill the power.
- I can't give that order.

517
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,865
If we shut down in a code epsilon,

518
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,868
the servers and drives
will all self-immolate.

519
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,995
All 73 iterations.

520
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,373
We will have a complete core meltdown.

521
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,043
If you won't do it,

522
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,462
then I'll do it myself.

523
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,429
There.

524
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,184
Clear, clear, clear.

525
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,601
Save yourselves.

526
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,939
James!

527
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,108
This is your life's work.

528
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,610
The people in that room,
they signed their consent.

529
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,737
The knew what they were risking.

530
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,659
Don't sacrifice the world's pain
for six McMurphies.

531
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,541
I have to kill my simulated mother, Azumi.

532
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,525
God fucking damn it!

533
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,360
She's disabled everything.

534
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,363
There's no protocol for this.

535
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,242
See? It's not easy
to kill a mother's love.

536
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,909
You're...

537
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,746
I told him about that. You know?

538
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,624
- <i>Azumi!</i>
- You're in trouble up there.

539
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,459
This is what you've been practicing for.

540
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,837
- You've been practicing your whole life.
- Almost got it.

541
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,923
Only two sides left, Owen.
Come on. You got the bottom.

542
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,550
Build up those sides.

543
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,721
Save 'em, Owen!

544
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,307
You got the cross.

545
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,851
Nicely executed!

546
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,691
2

547
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,949
She's compliant.

548
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,787
"Subject One saves the day."

549
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,581
GRTA REBOOTS

550
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,583
Azumi, come here. Come here.

551
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,961
Take me to the mainframe.

552
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,678
It's the next one.

553
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,851
She's watching us, James.

554
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,688
If we're gonna do this,
we have to do it fast.

555
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,195
You must follow the sequence!

556
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,824
Guide me to the digital fascia.

557
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,582
No! Don't pull that.

558
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,961
Here.

559
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,089
Where am I?

560
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,759
Silicon temporal housing.

561
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,428
<i>James...</i>

562
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,141
<i>please don't punish me because I'm sad.</i>

563
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,199
I think I can see.

564
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,120
I can see.

565
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,622
<i>Dr. Fujita...</i>

566
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,834
<i>are you going to put me under?</i>

567
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,173
I'm sorry.

568
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,385
<i>Will I ever wake up again?</i>

569
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,437
Separating the Boolean thalamus...

570
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,108
from the stochastic prefrontal cortex.

571
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,367
I tried.

572
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,119
I tried to help her.

573
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,087
I failed.

574
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,355
Hey. Hey.

575
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,736
You okay?

576
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,115
Yeah.

577
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,244
Where's your sister?

578
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,624
She's gone.

1
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,669
Annie, are you okay?

2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,672
Not now, Owen.

3
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,429
What? What? They're awake?

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,181
They're not dead?

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,267
They're alive. You woke up!

6
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,935
Were we not supposed to?

7
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,354
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,149
- So nice of you to come.
- Congratulations.

9
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,027
- Good to see you. You look wonderful.
- Congratulations.

10
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,071
Hello, hello. So good to see you, yes.

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,239
Are you feeling pure, unaffected joy?

12
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,746
Why are they all staring at us?

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,791
- Like we're in a zoo.
- No, like cattle...

14
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,375
in a slaughterhouse.

15
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,045
Fuck the Evens.

16
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,005
I'm a big fan. I have all your books.

17
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,424
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,220
You've just completed
the 73rd iteration...

19
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,012
of the ULP.

20
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,141
It's been a complete success.

21
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,103
Congratulations.

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,521
You're healed.

23
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,734
<i>Years of work...</i>

24
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>years of research...</i>

25
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,781
<i>hundreds of millions invested.</i>

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,449
<i>Idiots.</i>

27
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,705
You can speak to them that way,
but you cannot speak to me that way.

28
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,917
Perhaps you know me from my books,
my radio program.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,877
I'm globally recognized.

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,217
<i>My technicians cannot locate
the consciousness you created.</i>

31
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,761
<i>They believe she may have slipped away.</i>

32
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,303
That's not true.

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,721
<i>Mmm.</i>

34
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,517
She no longer exists.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,229
<i>Muramoto's family
intends to file a lawsuit.</i>

36
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,857
- I intend to sue as well.
- <i>Good for you.</i>

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,985
You stole my mind from me for profit.

38
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,613
The combination of hubris and idiocy
is inconceivable.

39
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,448
<i>I agree.</i>

40
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:42,412
I advise that you never allow my son
to practice in this industry again.

41
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,081
For his sake, as well as all of humanity.

42
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,418
<i>I assure you, he will not.</i>

43
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,128
Fine.

44
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,259
<i>Do you have anything
to say for yourself?</i>

45
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,386
I believe I've...

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,389
said everything that I...

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,641
needed to say.

48
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,937
Fine.

49
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,196
- Well, Mother, I...
- Yes.

50
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,989
- I suppose...
- Yes.

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,619
You and I could share a very brief...

52
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,538
lunch together sometime.

53
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,625
- I'm leaving the country.
- Oh.

54
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:33,046
I'm going on a 47-city book tour,
all seven continents.

55
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,129
Oh.

56
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,759
So you and I won't
be seeing each other again...

57
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,093
for...

58
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,055
quite some time.

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,348
Until then.

60
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,724
Until then.

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,776
<i>Your idiocy regarding the ULP
may be useful to me...</i>

62
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,611
<i>in a private matter</i>

63
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,579
Keep it.

64
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,375
I'm sorry I said all that stuff.

65
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,503
There was never a guy with a van.
I would never hurt your daughter.

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,796
I hope it was worth it.

67
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,589
Remember your NDA.

68
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,760
- Thanks.
- Remember your NDA.

69
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,222
Please remember you signed an NDA.

70
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,891
Remember your NDA.

71
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,811
Remember you signed an NDA.

72
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,188
Remember your NDA.

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,947
Hey. Hey.

74
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,246
I know you're probably
still processing all that.

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,585
I just wanted to let you know I'm...

76
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,380
I'm gonna leave you alone.

77
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,174
I won't, like, follow you around
in regular life.

78
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,842
What?

79
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,304
I won't make more of this than it was.

80
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,101
I didn't think you were going to.

81
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,604
I have a problem with that. I...

82
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,149
I get weird.

83
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,735
Okay.

84
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,448
If that's what you think.

85
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,117
Bye, Annie.

86
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,785
Bye, Owen.

87
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,927
I'm sorry about...

88
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,347
everything.

89
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,019
I know it wasn't easy to bring me back.

90
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,730
It was the only choice.

91
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,360
The calculation failed, but I believe
it would have failed in any case.

92
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,824
I was the one who created an...
intolerable situation for Gertie.

93
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,746
The work you did with the GRTA
was remarkable...

94
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,039
Azumi.

95
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,958
Perhaps...

96
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,420
Gertie was the real project.

97
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,191
Room E, phase three?

98
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,609
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

99
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,736
Remarkable work they're doing up there.

100
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,744
I'm starting to think that your kiss,

101
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,455
not my mother's behavior,
was the catalyst for my...

102
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,376
temporary failure of my visual cortex.

103
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,838
During my hysterical blindness,
I had this...

104
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,631
vision that...

105
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,343
An internally generated vision...

106
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,562
It's called a fantasy, James.

107
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,645
Yes.

108
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,814
A fantasy.

109
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,360
You and I were at sea.

110
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,198
You were my first mate...

111
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,982
and nurturing life partner...
and we were on a journey.

112
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,707
To where?

113
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,710
The lost city of Atlantis.

114
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,795
Oh.

115
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,882
What is it?

116
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,303
- It's just I don't like boats.
- Oh.

117
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,500
Can I give you a lift somewhere?

118
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,128
You know how to drive?

119
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,929
My therapist told me
it might help.

120
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,429
Yes.

121
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,307
That sounds...

122
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,976
most excellent.

123
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,149
James, it's this one.

124
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,153
Of course.

125
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,333
<i>There's no greater tragedy
than the destruction of a family.</i>

126
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,794
<i>You can be the one
to hold them all together.</i>

127
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,397
<i>- Daddy!
- Daddy's Home.</i>

128
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,758
<i>Share your joy with others
and make yourself feel whole again.</i>

129
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,245
- I thought it was gonna be everyone.
- Just me.

130
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,290
You look nice.

131
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,542
How are you feeling?

132
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,962
- You don't have to be worried.
- I'm not worried.

133
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,466
You're worried I'm gonna ruin Jed's trial,
and I'm not, okay?

134
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,425
It's okay.

135
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,680
I think you're going to tell the truth
and help him.

136
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,140
It makes me proud.

137
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,144
Can't I be proud?

138
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,814
Yeah, you can. Sorry.

139
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,568
By the way, has...

140
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,405
anyone...

141
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,869
approached you and tried to get you
to change your story about Jed?

142
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,038
- What do you mean?
- Uh...

143
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:52,878
Have you encountered any strangers
trying to manipulate you?

144
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,172
Because I've heard
that sometimes these women

145
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,300
who make false accusations
against the wealthy

146
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:04,765
will sometimes hire people
to... to intimidate and confuse witnesses.

147
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,893
I think there's even a service.

148
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,897
No strangers, no.

149
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,071
Would you describe your brother
as a good person?

150
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,613
Yes.

151
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,035
Yes?

152
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,621
Have you ever seen
your brother engage in an act

153
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,875
of consensual or non-consensual urination?

154
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,711
- Absolutely not.
- And have you ever...

155
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,213
- We have a new settlement offer.
- What terms?

156
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,839
Generous.

157
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,260
How many times do I have to tell you guys?

158
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,304
We are not settling.

159
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,221
Why not?

160
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,890
Because it's bullshit. That's why.

161
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,976
Then I wouldn't have to lie under oath.

162
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,605
Look, this is a one-time thing.

163
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,860
My oldest son made a mistake.
Any settlement will ruin our family name.

164
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,738
And if this... woman,

165
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,240
if she can't find the generosity
to forgive Jed

166
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,159
for something that she agreed to,

167
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,288
then we as a family
will rip it out of her chest cavity.

168
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,832
That's a confusing metaphor.

169
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,753
That's how the Milgrim family
deal with our enemies.

170
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,737
Don't let this happen, Owen.

171
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,242
I'm a horrible person.

172
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,954
Adelaide's gonna leave me.

173
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,793
I don't know how this happened.

174
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,876
Jed...

175
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,721
These are real fucking tears, Owen.

176
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,017
You're either a part of this family
or you're not.

177
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,230
I buzzed him up at 7:05.

178
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,568
I know the time
because he's always five minutes late,

179
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,945
and I asked him to be there at seven.

180
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,406
And I know we were there for four hours

181
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,617
because that's how long
it takes me to beat him at Risk.

182
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:35,916
So, is it possible for Jed Milgrim
to have been at the office at 8:25?

183
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,670
Not unless someone could be two places
at the same time.

184
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,591
Objection, Your Honor.
There is no real documented time line.

185
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,552
- Overruled.
- No further questions, Your Honor.

186
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,472
Nobody can be two places at once,

187
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,017
but everyone has to be somewhere.

188
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,435
Do you agree, Mr. Milgrim?

189
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,148
I don't understand the question.

190
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,735
You have no data portals
in your micro apartment.

191
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:07,531
You live in a building with no doorman
and no security monitoring whatsoever.

192
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,450
- That's true.
- Why?

193
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,786
I prefer to be disconnected.

194
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,372
In a sense, you're invisible,
aren't you?

195
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,456
Sure.

196
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,667
Then let's see something visible.

197
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,295
At this point, Your Honor,
we'd like to introduce

198
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,380
the plaintiff's exhibit eight.

199
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,633
Video footage pulled
from the closed-circuit system

200
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,135
of the defendant's place of work.

201
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,513
Do you recognize this place, Mr. Milgrim?

202
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,309
That is the factory floor
of my father's company.

203
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,684
And this?

204
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,406
That's the stairwell
of my father's company.

205
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,065
What do you see happening here?

206
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,984
I see a man groping a woman.

207
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,695
This is the man

208
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,656
who used his power in the workplace

209
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,159
to force my client
into a heinous sexual act.

210
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,563
The defense's entire case

211
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,608
rests on you not believing
your very own eyes,

212
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,860
and instead believing Owen Milgrim.

213
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,781
Mr. Milgrim, were you diagnosed
with schizophrenia ten years ago?

214
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,867
Objection.
Irrelevant and prejudicial, Your Honor.

215
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,994
Overruled.

216
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,829
Answer the question Mr. Milgrim.

217
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,249
Are you schizophrenic,
Mr. Milgrim?

218
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,544
Yes.

219
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,715
Are you on any
anti-psychotic medications?

220
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,094
I'm supposed to be,
but I stopped taking them a while ago.

221
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,805
Do you ever get confused
about your brother, Jed?

222
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,474
As in you believe you're seeing him,

223
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,353
when, in fact, you are imagining
someone who just looks like him.

224
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
Not anymore.

225
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,735
And do you have trouble telling
the difference between what is real

226
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,486
and what's not?

227
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,491
- Sometimes I do, yes.
- Objection, Your Honor,

228
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,702
the witness is clearly having
a panic attack...

229
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,872
I would like to submit my testimony.

230
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,083
As I said before,

231
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,588
this entire case rests
on what Mr. Milgrim thinks of this image.

232
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,593
Does this man
look like your brother, Jed Milgrim?

233
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,765
It doesn't look like him.

234
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,932
See? I told you.

235
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,187
It is him.

236
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,524
What the fuck did he just say?

237
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,152
It's obviously him.

238
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,487
Motherfucker.

239
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,821
Just to clarify,

240
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,705
- your brother wasn't with you...
- I'm saying I lied, and he's guilty,

241
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,452
and he's a monster,
and I'm sorry for lying.

242
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,746
I'm not a liar.
He's guilty and he did it.

243
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,975
- No further questions.
- Your Honor, I move to redirect

244
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,001
and treat Mr. Milgrim
as a hostile witness.

245
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,445
It's too late, Counsel.
You've already examined him.

246
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,713
Motion denied.

247
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,049
No further questions, Your Honor.

248
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,595
You're dead. You're fucking dead.
I'm gonna kill you.

249
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm gonna kill you my fucking self.

250
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,973
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

251
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,851
I need to tell you something.

252
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,605
I need to tell you
that it's not okay for me...

253
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,065
out here...

254
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,820
all by myself.
It was before, but it's not anymore.

255
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,410
Yes, you married a woman...

256
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,537
who was sick.

257
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,292
And she couldn't handle having a family,
and she left us.

258
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,377
And it broke your heart.

259
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,422
And then your daughter died.

260
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,259
And it was the wrong one.

261
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,721
It was the easier one...

262
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,237
who was good at life. Who made you laugh.

263
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,106
Who didn't cause problems,
who always called you.

264
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,651
Who didn't remind you of her mother.

265
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,991
And it's okay that you had to go in there,
but I don't accept it anymore.

266
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,078
I need you out here.

267
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,165
We are the only ones left.

268
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,376
I need you out here with me, Dad.

269
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,051
- I'm lonely.
- I take it your trip to Salt Lake...

270
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,261
opened things up.

271
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,598
What are you doing?

272
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,184
Annie, I don't think that,

273
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,478
what you said about the wrong one.

274
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,521
I don't... I don't think that.

275
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,776
Did you steal all my money?

276
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,238
I can pay you back.

277
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,532
When I saw how much you took,
I figured you weren't coming back.

278
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,867
I just figured, well...

279
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,577
there it is.

280
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,373
The third and final Irish exit.

281
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,666
I'm sorry.

282
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,209
Don't be.

283
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,129
How was it?

284
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,340
I didn't go.

285
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,301
Not technically.

286
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,430
Your brain is not melted, at least.

287
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,474
It would have been painless, I heard.

288
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,060
According to the, uh...

289
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,021
insane computer.

290
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,066
She was going through a lot.

291
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,902
Well...

292
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,574
You seem good, Annie.

293
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,298
I don't feel good. How is she? How did...

294
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,248
- How'd she seem?
- Who?

295
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,916
Ellie.

296
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,585
Um...

297
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,338
None of that was real.

298
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,427
You get that.
I just... made up a version of her.

299
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,637
Maybe but, you know,

300
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,098
who really knows how this stuff works.

301
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,559
So, how'd she seem?

302
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,314
She seemed like herself.

303
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,774
Good.

304
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,614
Anything come to you
in the last three days?

305
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,700
I don't know. I think so.

306
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,498
But honestly, I feel confused.
I feel like maybe I did it wrong.

307
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,961
Owen listened to all of my stories.

308
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,674
But in the reflections, I kept giving him
all these reasons not to trust me,

309
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,302
but he just... kept trying to help me.

310
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,221
He acted like a friend.

311
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,904
<i>I want to talk to you
about something</i>

312
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,898
<i>you've been avoiding since you got here.</i>

313
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,398
Okay.

314
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,320
You talked about what happened
at the drug trial,

315
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,490
and you talked about
what you went through with your family,

316
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,243
but I still don't understand why you never
tried to talk to Annie again.

317
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,998
Because there were two options,
and neither could end well.

318
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,085
What are the two options?

319
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,421
Option A, she doesn't really exist.

320
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,717
I look up her name,
figure out where she lives,

321
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,012
and realize there's no one on Earth
with that name.

322
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,557
Next, I go
to Neberdine Pharmaceutical Bio Tech

323
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,687
and find out there's no such thing
as Neberdine Pharmaceutical Bio Tech.

324
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,439
What about option B?

325
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,943
Option B's even worse.

326
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,786
<i>Owen, look.</i>

327
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,746
<i>I was so focused on my own shit.</i>

328
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,124
I should have said I care about you,

329
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,170
and that after everything we've been
through, I can't not have you in my life.

330
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,966
Because it's really hard...

331
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,844
to actually just connect with somebody.

332
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,680
And... when you do...

333
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,475
you don't... You can't just run away.

334
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,352
Hey, Annie...

335
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,521
you don't have to explain it.

336
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,233
I know how special our connection is.

337
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,488
It means so much to me that you would
ask me to come with you to San...

338
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,323
to Salt Lake City.

339
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,368
Hmm.

340
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,582
Uh, Annie, I love you.

341
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,003
And I'm not gonna let my schizophrenia
get in the way

342
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,339
of these two big, beautiful beating hearts

343
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,675
because we're meant to be together.

344
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,052
Anna, I, uh...

345
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,239
- Um...
- What are you doing?

346
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,140
- Annie.
- No, no. You know what? No.

347
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,683
Will you marry me?

348
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,601
No.

349
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,684
- What?
- No? No.

350
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,397
- Just stop.
- Oh, I guess I misread the file.

351
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,776
Yeah, it's not like that at all,
and you're doing him wrong.

352
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,862
It needs to feel like pain,

353
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,031
but not an awful kind of pain.

354
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,493
It's like this low-level sadness
that has a lot of...

355
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,621
caring and sweetness underneath it.

356
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,580
Forget it.

357
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,499
That's a lot to remember, but, uh...

358
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,125
Are you firing me?

359
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,252
I can't lose another one, fuck.

360
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,632
This is...

361
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,843
This is real Owen.

362
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,032
Oh, they had me committed?
There's no way this is a coincidence.

363
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,687
This... This is a sign, Friend Proxy Owen.

364
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,650
Maybe the universe isn't total chaos.

365
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,609
That's comforting.

366
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,488
Let's do this.

367
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,074
Hey!

368
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,369
Oh, I wasn't going to get in any way.

369
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,994
Cue the music.

370
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,581
There she goes.

371
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,292
Okay, can't really drive stick.

372
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,628
Stuck in Bushwick.

373
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,131
God, I hate my fucking life.

374
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,215
Hello.

375
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
Would you sign in
and check your bag, please?

376
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,443
Oh, sure.

377
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,531
For you, sir.

378
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,074
- Hey, there.
- Hello. Just here to visit my niece.

379
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,248
My husband is already inside, so...

380
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm late. I'm in trouble.

381
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,025
- Here you go. Thank you.
- All good?

382
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,884
- Okay, where should I go?
- Right here.

383
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

384
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,957
What are you doing?

385
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,503
- What the fuck are you doing here, Owen?
- Moving benches.

386
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,222
- My family had me committed.
- I know that, idiot.

387
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,932
I mean, what are you doing in <i>here?</i>

388
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,893
This isn't even a state-run facility.

389
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,393
I'm crazy.

390
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,942
You're not fucking crazy, Owen.

391
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,362
Come on, you're just kind of crazy.

392
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,116
I made some threats to powerful people.

393
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,619
I sent anthrax to the governor.

394
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,454
Your brother did that.

395
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,456
I had a blip...

396
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,584
in college. I should be here. I'm sick.

397
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,668
Okay.

398
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,587
Maybe you're diagnosed,

399
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,673
maybe you need to be medicated,

400
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,799
but this...

401
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,427
This does not work for me, Owen.

402
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,847
I don't think it works for you either.

403
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,601
So you saw some things
that weren't there. So what?

404
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:11,022
People see aliens, people hear voices,
people see ghosts.

405
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,357
That's different.

406
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,528
My mind, it...

407
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,031
- It doesn't work right.
- No one's does.

408
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,373
I'm gonna go into that bathroom
right there...

409
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,917
and 30 seconds later,

410
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,294
you're gonna go into that bathroom.

411
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,837
You get me?

412
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,672
No.

413
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,341
What is the problem?

414
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,801
I'm afraid.

415
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,884
Of what?

416
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,347
Option B.

417
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,813
Annie, the same thing happens
every time I meet someone

418
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,356
or get close to someone.

419
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,233
I mess it up.

420
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,072
I'm gonna get frustrated...

421
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,325
one day, and yell at you out of nowhere,

422
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,829
over something insignificant
I'm fixated on.

423
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,500
And then you'll stop calling back.

424
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,255
And you'll change your number
and it'll break my heart.

425
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,638
It's just easier if you're not real.

426
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,891
But I am real.

427
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
You know me.

428
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,941
You're braver than this, Owen.

429
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,445
And I will never do that to you.

430
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,362
Never.

431
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,118
Thirty seconds.

432
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,628
Thirty seconds.

433
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,856
Hey.

434
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
Come in here.

435
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,234
Come on.

436
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,317
Lock the door.

437
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,875
Our niece is out there.
We were visiting.

438
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,253
She's the one dancing by the wall.

439
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,839
It was a great visit,
but, you know, it's over now.

440
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,382
And you're Bruce.

441
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,550
I'm Linda.

442
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,178
Sorry these are weird. They're my dad's.

443
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,473
Owen, I saw this in a movie. It works.

444
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,933
Here.

445
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,731
Put 'em on.

446
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,902
Owen.

447
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,166
Annie, why are you here?

448
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,336
Because I'm your friend.

449
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,009
And that's what friends do.

450
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,928
Okay.

451
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,612
Hey.

452
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,030
Didn't you come in alone?

453
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,116
No, we were together.
You're seeing things.

454
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,452
Uh, I'm pretty sure you came in alone.

455
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,164
I'm pretty sure she came in alone.

456
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,748
Uh...

457
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,919
Let me see the sign in sheet.

458
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:06,257
- Is that the truck?
- Yes, yes, my dad gave it to me.

459
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,341
Just get in.

460
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,010
Let's go, come on. Go, go, go.

461
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,562
It's open! Get in!

462
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,565
That's Harpo. She's a rescue.

463
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,069
- Dammit.
- What's wrong?

464
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,113
This just happens
when I try to start cars.

465
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,843
Owen, will you go to Salt Lake City with me?
I don't technically have a driver's license.

466
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,164
Yes! You've gotta start the car, though.

467
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,165
Okay. Okay.

468
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,267
Go!

469
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,210
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

470
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,548
Annie, be careful!

471
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,384
Go, go!

472
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,134
Hey, hey!

473
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,636
Hey, hey, stop!

474
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,890
Annie, be careful!

475
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,517
I got it. We're good.

476
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,018
Shit, I missed the exit.

477
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,068
Hey! Stop!

478
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,654
Let go! We're good.
We're fine. We're fine. Bye!

479
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,656
Stop!

480
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,036
This is it.

481
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,330
This is it.

482
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,122
<i>It's a ridiculous theory.</i>

483
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,291
<i>More something my mother
would have cooked up.</i>

484
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,835
<i>- I'd like to hear it.
- Oh, you would?</i>

485
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,422
<i>- It's a long way to Newfoundland.
- Okay, yes. Well...</i>

486
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,549
<i>it begins like this.</i>

487
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,677
<i>Two billion years ago, an amoeba...</i>

488
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,597
<i>How far away is Salt Lake City?</i>

489
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,640
<i>It's far.</i>

490
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,226
<i>And I'm not entirely sure</i>

491
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,591
<i>this truck is gonna be able to get us
the whole way there,</i>

492
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,606
<i>but, you know, we'll get there one day.</i>

493
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,735
<i>Do we actually know each other?</i>
